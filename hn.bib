  abstract = {As the computational resources available to aerodynamicists increase, so does the number of tools with which they can analyze their designs. The key skill of a good engineer is understanding when each tool produces realistic results. Even if no available tool can capture all relevant physical phenomena, this knowledge allows engineers to alter their designs to account for the missing physics. However, with the increasing use of numerical optimization for aerodynamic shape design, the opportunity for this intuition to shape the design is reduced as the optimizer makes design decisions based purely on numerical results. This makes the choice of analysis method critical. Previous studies have compared panel-based aerodynamic tools and RANS CFD to predict and analyze the key aerodynamic phenomena in different flight conditions. But few, if any, have compared the impact of proper tool selection on the optimal aerodynamic shapes. In this work we show the effect of aerodynamic analysis method selection on the optimal aerodynamic shape and the consequences of choosing one that does not capture the relevant flow physics. In particular, we show that modelling boundary layer transition can produce significantly lower drag designs across almost the entire range of Reynolds numbers at which airfoils are used in practice. Additionally, we find that the simple compressibility correction used in XFOIL is sufficient to produce well performing airfoils for flight Mach numbers up to 0.65, after which point the ability for the flow solver to model shock formation is critical. Our results will provide aerodynamicists with the data and intuition to make informed decisions when selecting analysis methods for optimization.},

Foils have been fitted to a large number of yachts with great success, ranging from dinghies to ocean racers. An interesting question is whether one of the slowest racing boats in the world, the Optimist dinghy, can foil, and if so, at what minimum wind speed. The present paper presents a comprehensive design campaign to answer the two questions. The campaign includes a newly developed Velocity Prediction Program (VPP) for foiling/non-foiling conditions, a wind tunnel test of sail aerodynamics, a towing tank test of hull hydrodynamics and a large number of numerical predictions of foil characteristics. An optimum foil configuration is developed and towing tank tested with satisfactory results. The final proof of the concept is a successful on the water test with stable foiling at a speed of 12 knots.},

Advances in computational and experimental research have led to a better understanding of this multiphase phenomenon, thus enabling researchers to predict and alleviate its adverse effects on hydrofoil performance. In this work, a new BEM-based adjoint optimization prediction method, where the attached cavity is modeled as a free-streamline, is proposed for the analysis of partially cavitating hydrofoils that move with a constant speed beneath the free surface. Following an inverse problem approach, this potential method poses an alternative to higher-fidelity multiphase flow models for sheet cavitation with free surface effects for hydrofoils at moderate submergence depths and angles of attack. The proposed numerical scheme predicts well the cavity shape and cavitation number, under the given cavity length assumption, when compared against experimental data and other methods. The developed numerical tool could facilitate the preliminary design of partially cavitating lifting surfaces with, or without, free surface effects.},

Flettner rotors (hereafter: FRs) have been identified by several researchers as a promising solution to exploit wind energy on commercial ships, reducing fuel consumption. The present work presents a six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) ship performance model set up to evaluate the best way of using a pair of Flettner rotors. The study analyses the performance of this propulsion system in consideration of weather and sea conditions, evaluating the related reduction in fuel consumption. A discussion about the economic and environmental advantages of the usage of FRs is provided, considering the costs linked to their installation and the new emission restrictions. Relevant results have been obtained for different routes, speed ranges and rotor dimensions while investigating the best Flettner rotor arrangement to minimise both the emissions and the installation cost payback period.},

The foil is theoretically designed to have a wide cavitation-free bucket allowing a large range of cavitation-free angle of incidence (Eppler, R., 1990, Airfoil Design and Data, Springer-Verlag, Berlin). The inception cavitation numbers, the noise level, the velocity distribution, the minimum pressure coefficient, the cavitation patterns (bubble, leading edge ``band type'' cavitation, attached sheet cavity), together with the sheet cavity length have been experimentally determined. Effects on the velocity field have been studied too with a slightly developed cavitation. For angles of incidence larger than 1 deg, a great difference exists between the inception cavitation number and the theoretical minimum pressure coefficient. However it is in agreement with the measured one obtained from velocity measurements (for 0 deg\&lt;{$\alpha\&$}lt;6 deg). Discrepancy between theory and experiment on scale models is generally attributed to a flow separation at the leading edge. Although there are some indications of a separated flow at the leading edge, the velocity measurements do not show reverse flow with clearly detected negative velocities excepted for a large angle of incidence equal to 10 deg. Concerning sheet cavity development, the length cavity is found to scale as [{$\sigma$}/2{$\alpha-\alpha$}i{$\sigma$}]-m with m close to 2, for length cavities that do not exceed half the foil chord and for {$\sigma$}/2{$\alpha-\alpha$}i{$\sigma$} larger than about 30.

  abstract = {A numerical method is presented for solving two-dimensional uniform flow problems with a linearized free-surface boundary condition. The boundary-value problem governed by Laplace's equation is replaced by a weak formulation (also known as Galerkin's method) with certain essential boundary conditions. The infinite domain of the fluid is reduced to a finite domain by utilizing known solution spaces in certain subdomains. The bases for the trial and test functions are chosen from the same subspace of the polynomial function space in the reduced subdomain. The essential boundary conditions are properly taken into account by an unconventional choice of the basis for the trial functions, which is different from that for the test functions in other subdomains. This method is applied to two-dimensional steady flow past a submerged elliptic section, a hydrofoil at an arbitrary angle of attack, and a bump on the bottom. In each example the body boundary condition is satisfied exactly. Both subcritical and supercritical flows are treated. We present the numerical results of wave resistance, lift force, moment, circulation strength, and flow blockage parameter. The computed pressure distributions on the hydrofoil and wave profiles are shown. The test results obtained by the present method agree very well with existing results. The main advantage of this method is that any complex geometry of the boundary can be easily accommodated.},

The earlier investigations with the linear free-surface boundary condition have shown some disagreement between the computed results and the experimental measurements for the cases of shallow submergence. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of the nonlinear free-surface condition for the cases where the linear results show disagreement with the experimental measurements. The computational method of solution is the localized finite-element method based on the classical Hamilton's principle. In the present study, a notable step is introduced in the matching procedure between the fully nonlinear and the linear subdomains. The numerical results of wave resistance, lift force, and circulation strength are presented. The computed pressure distributions on the hydrofoil and wave profiles are shown and compared with the experimental measurements and also with the linear computational results. The present computed results show better agreement with the experimental results. In some cases, however, a difficulty in the convergence of the iterative solution procedure was experienced. This difficulty in the convergence may be due to the limit of the range of the existence of the true solution in potential-flow formulation.},

The 2-D hydrofoil is approximated by line panels which have constant source strength and constant doublet strength distributions.

All the terms in fundamental solution (Green function) of perturbation potential are integrated over a line panel. Pressure distribution, lift, residual drag and free surface deformations are calculated for NACA4412, symmetric Joukowski and van de Vooren profile types of hydrofoil. The results of this method show good agreement with both experimental and numerical methods in the literature for the NACA4412 and symmetric Joukowski profile types. The lift and residual drag values of the van de Vooren profile are also presented. The effect of free surface is examined by a parametric variation of Froude number and depth of submergence.},

  abstract = {The use of hydrofoils for sailing yachts is becoming more prolific. However its use in mainstream sailing classes has only become standard for the Moth dinghy class. The Moth class uses a twin T-Foil design, one on the centreboard for primary support and one on the rudder for additional support and control. The rudder T-Foil forms the basis of an experimental study carried out at the Australian Maritime College towing tank facility described here. Lift and drag data is presented for upright and heeled configurations considered indicative of windward sailing conditions. Force variation with respect to angle of incidence, depth of submergence and onset flow speed is presented using elliptical lift distribution parameters for easy design use. In addition deflection of the strut run-up was attempted to produce additional lift. Finally, a windward sailing condition prone to ventilation has been identified.},

In this paper, a multi-objective optimisation of the bow form of the standard ITTC KVLCC2 tanker was performed in terms of the AR, calm water resistance, total resistance and energy efficiency design index. The AR was estimated using semi-empirical formulas developed by the Ship Design Laboratory of NTUA. A parametric geometry model of ship's bow region and optimisation process were developed by use of the CAESES/FriendshipFramework. The conducted multi-objective optimisation procedure showed that the AR is strongly correlated to ship's waterplane area coefficient, moderately to ship's stem profile and weakly to the bow's flare angle. The optimised bow design resembles closely the LEADGE-bow hull concept, which is becoming very popular in recent full type ship new-buildings.},

Giving the optimizer the freedom to discover novel wing designs may increase the likelihood of multimodality in the design space. To address this issue, this study investigates the existence and possible sources of multimodality in the aerodynamic shape optimization of a rectangular wing. Our test case, specified by the ADODG Case 6, has a high dimensionality design space and a large degree of flexibility within that design space. Several subproblems of this benchmark test case are studied, and the multimodality introduced by each set of variables is analyzed considering both inviscid and viscous analysis. This methodical approach allows us to isolate a few instances where certain parametrizations create a multimodal design space. However, this study demonstrates that these occurrences of multimodality are due to modeling inaccuracies or can be curbed by the application of practical design constraints. Additionally, it is found that the shape of the optimized wing is highly dependent on the interplay between induced and parasite drag, providing more incentive to consider viscous effects in the analysis. As an example, when minimizing drag with respect to chord distribution, there are multiple local minima at low CL, but a single global minimum (the elliptical planform) at high CL. These results will help other researchers avoid some of the pitfalls that could lead to multimodality in wing optimization.},

Evaluation of the resulting formulas is effected for two arbitrary load distributions and a comparison with some model test results is made. A practical approximation which gives the influence of gravity over a range of high Froude numbers is found and from this one can deduce a Froude number beyond which the effects of gravity may be ignored.

  abstract = {The fluid dynamic design of hydrofoils involves most of the typical difficulties of aeronautical wings design with additional complexities related to the design of a device operating in a multiphase environment. For this reason, ``high fidelity'' analysis solvers should be, in general, adopted also in the preliminary design phase. In the case of modern fast foiling sailing yachts, the appendages accomplish both the task of lifting up the boat and to make possible upwind sailing by contributing balance to the sail side force and the heeling moment. Furthermore, their operative design conditions derive from the global equilibrium of forces and moments acting on the system which might vary in a very wide range of values. The result is a design problem defined by a large number of variables operating in a wide design space. In this scenario, the device performing in all conditions has to be identified as a trade-off among several conflicting requirements. One of the most efficient approaches to such a design challenge is to combine multi-objective optimization strategies with experienced aerodynamic design.This paper presents a numerical optimization procedure suitable for foiling multihulls. As a proof of concept, it reports, as an application, the foils design of an A-Class catamaran. The key point of the method is the combination of opportunely developed analytical models of the hull forces with high fidelity multiphase analyses in both upwind and downwind sailing conditions. The analytical formulations were tuned against a database of multiphase analyses of a reference demihull at several attitudes and displacements.An aspect that significantly contributes to both efficiency and robustness of the method is the approach adopted to the geometric parametrization of the foils which was implemented by a mesh morphing technique based on Radial Basis Functions.},

Over the past few years, our research group has developed a framework that allows carrying out high-fidelity aerostructural optimization by coupling a RANS CFD solver to an FEM solver that uses shell elements. In addition, we have recently developed OpenAeroStruct, a light-weight and open-source tool for low-fidelity aerostructural optimization that couples a VLM code to an FEM code that uses spatial beam elements. Due to their low cost, such low-fidelity tools remain useful for design studies.

Thus, the objective of this research is to quantify and characterize the hydrodynamic performance and hysteresis response of hydrofoil geometries in ventilated flows. We present a set of empirical equations to predict the hydrodynamic performance in fully wetted (FW) and fully ventilated (FV) flows, as well as ventilation inception and rewetting angles, which govern the hysteresis response. Predictions using the empirical equations compared reasonably well with published data of hydrofoils with varying geometries, submerged aspect ratios, angles of attack, and advance speeds. The results show that while the lift coefficient is practically independent of the speed in FW flow, it tends to decrease with increasing speed in FV flow due to the reduction in effective camber as the ventilated cavity lengthens. Ventilation incepts at lower angles of attack as Froude number (Fnh ) increases. The rewetting angle decreases with increasing Fnh . The efficiency decreases upon flow transition from FW to FV flow, and the drop becomes more severe with increasing Fnh . These empirical equations represent a simple and effective means to predict the hydrodynamic performance and hysteresis response of hydrofoils in ventilated flows.},

In the fishing industry, ships lines in non-developed countries and in small traditional ships are normally not optimized what leads to a no optimal use of the resources and operation. In this work this topic is treated. The lines of two fishing vessels are studied numerically and compared with towing tank experiments. Those lines from a displacement and a semi-displacement hull, are optimized by adding a new type of bow named as dihedral bulbous bow. This bow produces a reduction over 10\% of the ship's resistance. This work focuses on explaining numerically why that difference occurs. The bulbous bow reduces the pressure resistance by softening the flow that reaches the bow.},

The uncertainties involved in the optimization process are addressed and a general formulation for robust design is given. Specifically, the uncertainties involved in the decision making process are taken into account by means of their probabilistic distributions. The expected values and the standard deviations of the relevant quantities are assessed and included in the optimization objectives, whereas the constraints are evaluated in the worst case. This leads to a robust design able to keep a good performance in the whole probabilistic operating scenario. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is used for the global minimization process, minimizing the expectation and the standard deviation of the unit transportation cost.},

In this approach only the liquid phase is simulated and the level set function is used as tracking device to locate the free surface position. The extrapolation of the solution in the dummy points in the gaseous phase is such that second-order accuracy is maintained also in the points adjacent to the free surface; the time evolution of the level set function and the re-initialization step have been merged so to get a function which is a distance function everywhere, and satisfies, at the same time, the kinematic condition on the free surface. The implementation of this technique into a general purpose Reynolds averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations solver developed at INSEAN [Di Mascio A, Broglia R, Favini B. A Second Order Godunov-type Scheme for Naval Hydrodynamics. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers; 2001, p. 253--61], is described in details; capabilities of the algorithm in dealing with non-breaking and breaking flows in the naval hydrodynamic context will be demonstrated by using a submerged hydrofoil and two different ship hulls in straight course as test cases. Comparisons with both experimental data and numerical surface fitting computations are presented; convergence properties of the algorithm, as well as validation and verification assessment will be also discussed.},

It was found that at `incipient breaking' the first wave existed in either a breaking or a non-breaking state depending on the starting procedures. It was possible to induce steady breaking when the wave slope was 17{$^\circ$} or higher.

The boundary-value problem is reduced to a system of integral and integro-differential equations in the velocity modulus along the free boundaries and the velocity angle along the hydrofoil surface, both written as a function of parametric variables. The system of equations is solved through a numerical procedure, which is validated in the cases of a cavitating flat plate and non-cavitating shaped hydrofoils by comparison with data available in the literature. The results are presented in a wide range of Froude numbers and depths of submergence in terms of the cavity and free-surface shapes and force coefficients.

Computations of the flow around the hulls were obtained from a validated nonlinear potential flow boundary element method. Using the multi-objective optimization algorithm, surrogate-based global optimization (SBGO) reduced the computational effort. Compared with the original hull, wave resistance of the optimal hulls was significantly reduced for the two larger ships at Froude numbers corresponding to their design speeds. Optimizing the hull of the containerships slightly reduced their wave added resistance and total resistance in regular head waves, while optimization of their hulls hardly affected wave-induced motions.},

Flapping propulsor's heave is induced by ship's motions, while pitching motion is set by an active control mechanism.

The instantaneous angle of attack is influenced by foil's oscillatory motion and the incident waves. We consider moderate submergence and speed, permitting us to approximately neglect effects of breaking waves and cavitation, and linearize the free-surface boundary conditions and the trailing vortex wake dynamics. Numerical calculations are presented concerning the performance of the developed BEM over a range of motion parameters and compared against other methods and experimental data. Our analysis indicates that significant efficiency is achieved under optimal operating conditions and the free surface effects cannot be neglected. In the presence of waves the thrust coefficient is observed to raise well above its value in infinite domain, with maximum gain reaching 20\%, for appropriate selection of the parameters. The present method could serve as a useful tool for the assessment, preliminary design and control of the studied system, extracting energy from sea waves for marine propulsion.},

  abstract = {In a fully developed sea, the significant wave height (Hs) and wind speed (U10) are conventionally related with a pure quadratic equation. This relation is often violated since in the field, the measured local \$Hs\$ is often contaminated by the swell, which is propagated from distant places. Therefore, a swell partition is required before the establishment of the wind wave relation. The Spectra Energy Partition (SEP) is regarded as the best way to isolate the swell and the wind-wave relation: it is based on the identification of a separation frequency in the ocean wave spectrum. However, for most field observations, the wave spectra information is unavailable, thus the SEP is inapplicable. This work proposes a probability-based algorithm to identify the averaged swell without knowing the wave spectrum a priori. The local wind-wave relation is established by either a linear or an energy-conserved decomposition. We also find that the local wind-wave relation is a power-law when the wind speed U10 is above 4 m/s. The proposed method is first validated by applying the SEP method to buoy collected wave spectra data. The global pattern of the swell and the local wind waves is retrieved by applying the proposed method to a 17-years wind and wave database from the JASON satellite. Strong seasonal and spatial variations are obtained. Finally, a prediction model based on the empirical wind wave relation is shown to successfully retrieve the wave field when the wind field is available.},

  abstract = {With recent advances in high-performance computing, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling has become an integral part in the engineering analysis and even in the design process of marine vessels and propulsors. In aircraft wing design, CFD has been integrated with numerical optimization and adjoint methods to enable high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization with respect to large numbers of design variables. There is a potential to use some of these techniques for maritime applications, but there are new challenges that need to be addressed to realize that potential. This work presents a solution to some of those challenges by developing a CFD-based hydrodynamic shape optimization tool that considers cavitation and a wide range of operating conditions. A previously developed three-dimensional compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver is extended to solve for nearly incompressible flows, using a low-speed preconditioner. An efficient gradient-based optimizer and the adjoint method are used to carry out the optimization. The modified CFD solver is validated and verified for a tapered NACA 0009 hydrofoil. The need for a large number of design variables is demonstrated by comparing the optimized solution obtained using different number of shape design variables. The results showed that at least 200 design variables are needed to get a converged optimal solution for the hydrofoil considered. The need for a high-fidelity hydrodynamic optimization tool is also demonstrated by comparing RANS-based optimization with Euler-based optimization. The results show that at high lift coefficient (C-L) values, the Euler-based optimization leads to a geometry that cannot meet the required lift at the same angle of attack as the original foil due to inability of the Euler solver to predict viscous effects. Single-point optimization studies are conducted for various target C-L values and compared with the geometry and performance of the original NACA 0009 hydrofoil, as well as with the results from a multipoint optimization study. A total of 210 design variables are used in the optimization studies. The optimized foil is found to have a much lower negative suction peak, and hence delayed cavitation inception, in addition to higher efficiency, compared to the original foil at the design C-L value. The results show significantly different optimal geometry for each C-L, which means an active morphing capability was needed to achieve the best possible performance for all conditions. For the single-point optimization, using the highest C-L as the design point, the optimized foil yielded the best performance at the design point, but the performance degraded at the off-design C-L points compared to the nnultipoint design. In particular, the foil optimized for the highest C-L showed inferior performance even compared to the original foil at the lowest C-L condition. On the other hand, the multipoint optimized hydrofoil was found to perform better than the original NAGA 0009 hydrofoil over the entire operation profile, where the overall efficiency weighted by the probability of operation at each C-L, is improved by 14.4\%. For the multipoint optimized foil, the geometry remains fixed throughout the operation profile and the overall efficiency was only 1.5\% lower than the hypothetical actively morphed foil with the optimal geometry at each C-L. The new methodology presented herein has the potential to improve the design of hydrodynamic lifting surfaces such as propulsors, hydrofoils, and hulls.},

  abstract = {The design optimization of flexible hydrofoils and propellers requires coupled hydrodynamic and structural analysis to achieve truly optimal, physically realizable, and structurally sound designs. To address this need, we develop an efficient high-fidelity hydrostructural design optimization approach that can handle large numbers of design variables, multiple design points, as well as design constraints on cavitation, maximum von Mises stress, and manufacturing tolerances. The hydrostructural solver couples a 3-D nearly incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes solver with a 3-D structural finite-element solver. We validate the solver by comparing the hydrodynamic load coefficients and tip bending deformations of a cantilevered aluminum alloy hydrofoil with a NACA 0009 cross section and a trapezoidal planform. We use a coupled adjoint approach for efficient computation of the performance and constraint function derivatives with respect to 210 shape design variables. A single-point hydrostructural optimization of the NACA 0009 baseline hydrofoil yields a 12.4\% increase in lift-to-drag ratio, a 2.5\% reduction in mass, and a 45\% increase in the cavitation inception speed. However, the performance of the single-point optimized hydrofoil is found to be worse than the baseline at off-design conditions. On the other hand, a multipoint optimization yields improved performance over the entire range of expected operating conditions with a weighted average increase in lift-to-drag ratio of 8.5\%, and an increased cavitation inception speed of 38\%. We compare the hydrostructural optimal result to an equivalent hydrodynamic-only optimization, and we show that only the hydrostructural optimized design satisfies the stress constraint up to the highest expected loading condition, highlighting the need for coupled hydrostructural optimization. The proposed approach enables multipoint optimization of hydrodynamic performance for hydrofoils and marine propulsors with respect to detailed shape while enforcing design constraints. This constitutes a powerful new tool for improving existing designs, and exploring new concepts.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, there has been an increased interest in the use of multidisciplinary optimization techniques for the design of aerospace, maritime, and wind engineering systems. However, validation of numerically optimized results using experimental measurements has been scarce. In this paper, numerical predictions are compared with experimental measurements of the hydrodynamic forces, deformations, and cavitation performance for a baseline NACA~0009 hydrofoil and an optimized hydrofoil. Both hydrofoils are made of solid aluminum, and are cantilevered at the root. One of the hydrofoils is optimized using a high-fidelity hydrostructural solver combined with a gradient-based optimizer, as detailed by Garg et al. (2017). The numerical predictions agree well with experimental measurements for both the baseline NACA~0009 and the optimized hydrofoils. For the optimized hydrofoil, the mean differences between the predicted and measured values for mean lift, drag coefficient, and moment coefficients, are 2.9\%, 5.1\%, and 3.0\%, respectively. For the non-dimensional tip bending deflection, the mean difference is 3.4\%. Although the optimized hydrofoil is significantly thicker to withstand higher loads than the baseline, it yields an overall measured increase in the lift-to-drag ratio of 29\% for lift coefficients ranging from -0.15 to 0.75 and exhibits significantly delayed cavitation inception compared to the baseline. The improvement in hydroelastic and cavitation performance is attributed to the changes in the distribution of camber, twist, thickness, and the leading edge radius of the optimized hydrofoil. The results validate the analysis and optimization of the high-fidelity hydrostructural design optimization approach, and opens up new possibilities for the design of high-performance hydrofoils, marine propellers, and turbines.},

On the undisturbed free surface source density is applied to satisfy the free surface condition that is defined by the first and second order solutions. After solving the doublet on the body and source on the free surface, the computational results of pressure, lift, wave drag, wave pattern and wave elevation can be calculated at various Froude numbers. The results for the surface piercing (such as strut and Wigley hull) and submerged moving hydrofoils have been presented.

  abstract = {This paper presents a Non-linear Dynamic Lifting Line (NDLL)-based method for analysing hydrofoil vessels in waves. The method is validated, and its utility is demonstrated in a case study. The NDLL accounts for dynamic and 3D effects through a panellized wake and allows the evaluation of the pressure distribution on hydrofoils. Improved models are presented for wake deformation, wake composition, hydrofoil interaction, and the viscous core of vortex wake models. Furthermore, an efficient way of accounting for Green function terms through a matrix interpolation method is presented. Validation is performed by comparison with aerodynamic and hydrodynamic experiments and new 3D RANS simulations. The RANS simulations focus on geometries and operating conditions deemed representative of hydrofoiling fast ferries. Predictions of steady and dynamic lift, drag, wake velocities and cavitation inception are evaluated, and results correspond well with the benchmark data. A simulator framework is introduced, which integrates the hydrodynamic model with kinetics, kinematics, and control system models. This enables analyses of free-running vessels under active control, including assessments of resistance, motions, and the hydrofoil pressure distribution. The case study constitutes a qualitative verification of the simulator and flight control tuning methods, and reveals the possibility of negative added resistance in waves.},

Quantitatively, we wish to maximize the standard hypervolume indicator metric, which measures the dominated hypervolume of the entire set of chosen inputs. In this paper, we introduce a novel scalarization function, which we term the hypervolume scalarization, and show that drawing random scalarizations from an appropriately chosen distribution can be used to efficiently approximate the hypervolume indicator metric. We utilize this connection to show that Bayesian optimization with our scalarization via common acquisition functions, such as Thompson Sampling or Upper Confidence Bound, provably co{\textsurd}nverges to the whole Pareto frontier by deriving tight hypervolume regret bounds on the order of O( T ). Furthermore, we highlight the general utility of our scalarization framework by showing that any provably convergent single-objective optimization process can be effortlessly converted to a multi-objective optimization process with provable convergence guarantees.},

In this paper, we present the theory and architecture of OpenMDAO, an open-source MDO framework that uses Newton-type algorithms to solve coupled systems and exploits problem structure through new hierarchical strategies to achieve high computational efficiency. OpenMDAO also provides a framework for computing coupled derivatives efficiently and in a way that exploits problem sparsity. We demonstrate the framework's efficiency by benchmarking scalable test problems. We also summarize a number of OpenMDAO applications previously reported in the literature, which include trajectory optimization, wing design, and structural topology optimization, demonstrating that the framework is effective in both coupling existing models and developing new multidisciplinary models from the ground up. Given the potential of the OpenMDAO framework, we expect the number of users and developers to continue growing, enabling even more diverse applications in engineering analysis and design.},

The foil design and the control systems have an important influence on the performance and stability of the vessel. Both foil and control system design also drive the maneuverability of the vessel and determine maneuvering procedures. The AC50 class requirements lead to complex foil control systems and the maneuvering procedures become sophisticated and multifaceted. Sailing and maintaining AC50 class yachts is a complex, expensive and time-consuming task. A dynamic velocity prediction program (DVPP) for the AC50 is therefore developed to assess the dynamic stability of different foil configurations and to simulate and optimize maneuvers. The goal 143 is to evaluate certain design ideas and maneuvering procedures with this simulator so that sailing time on the water can be saved. The paper describes the principal concepts of developing an AC50 model in the DVPP FSEquilibrium. The force components acting on the yacht are defined based on physical principles, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental investigations. The control systems for adjusting the aero- and hydrodynamic surfaces are modeled. Controllers are utilized to simulate the human behavior of performing sailing tasks. Maneuvers are then defined as sequences of crew actions and crew behaviors. In the paper examples of utilizing the DVPP in preparation for the 35th America's Cup in Bermuda are described. The DVPP is for example used to investigate the effect of different boat set-ups on stability and handling during maneuvers. With the sailing team, maneuver procedures are developed and tested. Procedures such as dagger board and rudder elevator movement and crew position are investigated and evaluated to minimize the distance lost during tacking and gybing. The DVPP is also employed for trajectory optimization during maneuvers.},

  abstract = {1. The horizontal force on a circular cylinder immersed in a stream is familiar as an example of wave resistance. The following note supplies a similar calculation for the resultant vertical force. The problem was sug\-gested in a consideration of the forces on a floating body in motion, the hori\-zontal and vertical forces and the turning moment; but the case of a partially immersed body presents great difficulties. It seemed, however, of sufficient interest to compare the resultant horizontal and vertical forces for a simple case of complete immersion for which the calculations can be carried out. The horizontal force, or wave resistance, has usually been obtained indirectly from considerations of energy, but a different method is adopted here for both components of force and the turning moment. In a former paper the method of successive images was applied to the problem of the circular cylinder, taking images alternately in the surface of the cylinder and in the free surface of the stream. Using these results to the required stage of approximation, the com\-plete force on the cylinder is now obtained as the resultant of forces between the sources and sinks within the cylinder and those external to it. The same method can be applied to any submerged body for which the image sytems are known, and the resultant force and couple calculated in the same manner. The proposition used in this method is that for a body in a fluid, the motion of which is due to given sources and sinks, the resultant force and couple on the body are the same as if the sources and their images attract in pairs accord\-ing to a simple law of force, inverse distance for the two-dimensional case and inverse square of the distance for point sources. This fairly obvious proposition follows directly from a contour integration in the two-dimensional case; and, in view of the application, the extension is given in 2 when the flow is due to a distribution of doublets. In 3 the horizontal and vertical force on a circular cylinder are obtained by this method, the former agreeing with the usual expression for the wave resistance. The different variation of the two components with velocity is of interest, and the expressions are graphed on the same scale. The additional vertical force due to velocity changes direction at a certain speed, and is clearly associated more with the surface elevation immediately over the centre of the cylinder. In 4 reference is made to the couple on the cylinder. This should, of course, be zero for a complete solution; it is verified that the method used here gives zero moment up to the stage of approximation in terms of the ratio of the radius of the cylinder to the depth of its centre.},

Whether they are mono or multihull, yachts are using foils to reduce their drag forces and then, to increase their speeds in a large range of wind and sea conditions. Several CFD-based studies have already been carried out in order to optimize the foil's shape and location on the hull, but feedbacks on the yacht's behavior is mainly given by the crew when sailing at sea. The aim of the present paper is to propose a complementary and faster approach that could help to predict and quantify the yacht behavior in calm water and in waves while sailing under foil's action. This approach is well known as a system-based modelling and is a mathematical method that leads to understand the complexity of a system from the study of its interactions in their entirety. The paper will present the ability of the system-based approach to predict the attitude of a catamaran while performing maneuvers such as turning circles with 35 degrees of rudder deflection and zigzag tests 10-10 and 20-20 for different initial Froude numbers and foil's shapes.},

Following the publication of the AC75 Class Rules for the 36th America's Cup (RNZYS, 2018) and since the brand new Open 60 Class yachts are all equipped with hydrofoils, the presented study will propose a system-based modelling coupled with a simplified FSI (fluid-structure interaction) method that leads to better understand the dynamic behavior of monohulls with deformable hydrofoils. The aim of the presented paper is to establish an innovative approach to assess appendage behavior in a dynamic VPP (velocity prediction program). For that purpose, dynamic computations are based on a 6DOF mathematical model derived from the general non-linear maneuvering equations (Horel, 2016). The force model is expressed as the superposition of 7 major force components expressed at the center of gravity of the yacht: gravity, hydrostatic, maneuvering, damping, propulsion, control and wave. As test cases, course keeping simulations are performed on an Open 60 yacht with control loops to simulate the sail trimmer, helmsman and foil trimmer when finding the optimal foil settings is needed. In first hand, IMOCA's polar diagrams are used as reference. In calm water and in waves, the influence of foil's shapes and stiffness (non-deformable, realistic, flexible) on the global behavior of the yacht is presented.},

The treatment is based upon the use of singularity distributions and thin foil theory. By assuming an appropriate series form for the vortex distribution representing the hydrofoil, it is shown that the problem can be reduced to the solution of a set of linear algebraic equations. These are solved by a collocation procedure. Numerical results for the performance characteristics are then given for several hydrofoil configurations, submergence depths, and Froude numbers. These indicate that operation at Froude numbers greater than about ten is practically equivalent to operation at infinite Froude number. However, at lower values of the Froude number and for all the configurations considered, Froude number effects are important, even at submergence depths of several chord lengths.},

The design parameters are length, thickness, and vertical location of a bulb. With respect to different choices of these design parameters in first two steps, three different shapes of initial bulbous bows are generated: O-type, Delta-type and Nabla-type. The hydrodynamics performances of the ship hull with the generated bulbous bow, such as wave drag, sinkage and trim, are evaluated by surface mesh based fast flow solver.

An adequate description of the joint distribution of met-ocean variables can be utilised for structural reliability analyses. This study focuses on the joint distribution of significant wave height and zero-up-crossing wave period with a mixture copula distribution model for total sea data. Each component of the mixture model is constructed using a Weibull distribution for the significant wave height, a lognormal distribution for the wave period, and a Gaussian copula function. A commonly used conditional model is used for a comparison with the proposed model. Several evaluation strategies are defined for an assessment of the performance of two fitted models utilising simulated bivariate samples. The results suggest that the condi\- tional model is unsuitable for a description of the pattern of the joint distribution, notably by seriously under\- estimating the return levels. By contrast, the mixture copula is capable of providing an improved performance, and thus provides extremely reliable environmental contours. Furthermore, the effects of seasonality and shortterm dependency on the joint behaviour of the spectral parameters are investigated and discussed based on the environmental contours.},

  abstract = {One of the challenges in computational modeling is coupling models to solve multidisciplinary problems. Flow-based computational frameworks alleviate part of the challenge through a modular approach, where data flows from component to component. However, existing flow-based frameworks are inefficient when coupled derivatives are needed for optimization. To address this, we develop the modular analysis and unified derivatives (MAUD) architecture. MAUD formulates the multidisciplinary model as a nonlinear system of equations, which leads to a linear equation that unifies all methods for computing derivatives. This enables flow-based frameworks that use the MAUD architecture to provide a common interface for the chain rule, adjoint method, coupled adjoint method, and hybrid methods; MAUD automatically uses the appropriate method for the problem. A hierarchical, matrix-free approach enables modern solution techniques such as Newton--Krylov solvers to be used within this monolithic formulation without computational overhead. Two demonstration problems are solved using a Python implementation of MAUD: a nanosatellite optimization with more than 2 million unknowns and 25,000 design variables, and an aircraft optimization involving over 6,000 design variables and 23,000 constraints. MAUD is now implemented in the open source framework OpenMDAO, which has been used to solve aircraft, satellite, wind turbine, and turbofan engine design problems.},

For a given sail plan, alterations in sail trim produce a wide range of combinations of lift, drag and heeling moment. While the original solution to this problem using the well-known parameters flat and reef has been very successful, it has some obvious defects. In particular, it does not correctly model the practice of twisting a sail to reduce heeling moment. This paper therefore sets out an improved model which satisfies the essential requirements for upwind sails; namely that the model is based upon fundamental aerodynamic principles, allows all the unknowns to be determined from tests (full scale or wind tunnel) and permits the best sail trim to be selected for optimization of performance. The essential new step is to introduce a new trim parameter twist which correctly accounts for the practice of allowing the head of a sail to twist off in order to reduce heeling moment.},

OpenAeroStruct combines a vortex lattice method and 1-D finite-element analysis to model lifting surfaces, such as aircraft wings and tails, and uses the coupled-adjoint method to compute the aerostructural derivatives. We use the Breguet range equation to compute the fuel burn as a function of structural weight and aerodynamic performance. OpenAeroStruct has proved effective both as an educational tool and as a benchmark for researching new MDO methods. There is much more potential to be exploited as the research community continues to develop and use this tool.},

An attempt is made to derive such an expression suited for the approximate calculation of this added resistance. The formulae obtained, which may be considered as empiric, contain but one factor, (dependent upon the ship's form) which should be evaluated by means of experiment. The present method makes it possible to calculate the resistance increase in regular head waves of any length and at any speed, provided that experimental results for merely one speed, or even for one specified wave length and corresponding (synchronous) speed are available. Moreover, by adopting an average value of the above mentioned factor, the added resistance can be calculated without any help of model experiments. Hence, the resistance increase in irregular head waves can be calculated as well, and, as an example, the results regarding an existing container ship are given and compared with actual full-scale data. Furthermore, the added resistance in any irregular head sea represented by a standard spectrum can be predicted very quickly by means of the enclosed graphs, which reproduce the numerical results of an adapted analytical treatment.},

  abstract = {Low-speed aerodynamics is important in the design and operation of aircraft flying at low Mach number, and ground and marine vehicles. This book offers a modern treatment of the subject, both the theory of inviscid, incompressible, and irrotational aerodynamics and the computational techniques now available to solve complex problems. A unique feature of the text is that the computational approach (from a single vortex element to a three-dimensional panel formulation) is interwoven throughout. Thus, the reader can learn about classical methods of the past, while also learning how to use numerical methods to solve real-world aerodynamic problems. This second edition brings the first entirely up to date, with a new chapter on the laminar boundary layer (emphasis on the viscous-inviscid coupling), the latest versions of computational techniques, and additional coverage of interaction problems. It includes a systematic treatment of two-dimensional panel methods and a detailed presentation of computational techniques for three-dimensional and unsteady flows. With extensive illustrations and examples, this book will be useful for senior and beginning graduate-level courses, as well as a helpful reference tool for practising engineers.--},

  abstract = {This research addresses the potential flow about a thin two-dimensional hydrofoil moving with constant velocity at a fixed depth beneath a free surface. The thickness-to-chord ratio of the hydrofoil and disturbances to the free stream are assumed to be small. These small perturbation assumptions are used to produce first-and second-order subproblems structured to provide consistent approximations to boundary conditions on the body and the free surface. Nonlinear corrections to the free-surface boundary condition are included at second order. Each subproblem is solved by a distribution of sources and vortices on the chord line and doublets on the free surface. After analytic determination of source and doublet strengths, a singular integral equation for the vortex strength is derived. This integral equation is reduced to a Fredholm integral equation which is solved numerically. Lift, wave drag, and free-surface shape are calculated for a flat plate and a Joukowski hydrofoil. The importance of free-surface effects relative to body effects is examined by a parametric variation of Froude number and depth of submergence.},

  abstract = {Sailing yacht design has relied on steady state optimization for a long time, through the use of Velocity Prediction Programs (VPP). Nonetheless they have proved inadequate to handle accurately the stability trade-offs demanded by the state-of-the-art appendages as well as to assess their seakeeping abilities. The present thesis focuses on the study and development of a Dynamic Velocity Prediction Program (DVPP), a time-domain simulation tool that enables such studies. The program allows for 6 degrees-of-freedom calculation and implement a multibody algorithm. Different wind and wave models are available. The calculation of the loads relies on a weakly non-linear system-based approach. The implemented models use either load calculations at runtime on the body mesh, polynomial regressions on pre-computed dataset or semi-empirical formulas. Particular care has been drawn to the progressive validation of the numerical tool and several test cases of increasing complexity are presented. An experimental campaign has been conducted in a towing tank. The variations of the radiation coefficients with speed are studied. The experimental data is used for validation of the DVPP for two situations of interest: motions and loads in waves, and water entry-exit sequences. Simulations of existing offshore yachts, an Ultim trimaran and an IMOCA monohull, are presented. They consider different transient situations, from a maneuver to varying environmental conditions and point out the interest of dynamic studies, allowing to open a different field of optimization than VPPs.},

  abstract = {Thanks to high lift-to-drag ratios, hydrofoils are of great interest for high-speed vessels. Modern sailing yachts fitted with foils have thus reached impressively high speeds on the water. But this hydrodynamic efficiency is achieved at the expense of stability. Accurate tradeoffs are therefore needed to ensure both performance and safety. While usual Velocity Prediction Programs (VPPs) are inadequate to assess dynamic stability, the varying nature of the offshore racing environment further complicates the task. Dynamic simulation in the time-domain is thus necessary to help architects assess their designs. This paper presents a system-based numerical tool which aims at predicting the dynamic behavior of offshore sailing yachts. A 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) algorithm is used, calculating loads as a superposition of several components (hull, appendage, sails). Part of them are computed at runtime while the others use pre-computed dataset, allowing a good compromise between efficiency and flexibility. Three 6DOF simulations of an existing offshore trimaran (a maneuver, unsteady wind conditions and quartering seas) are presented. They underline the interest of dynamic studies, demonstrating how important the yacht state history is to the understanding of her instantaneous behavior and showing that dynamic simulations open a different field of optimization than VPPs.},

The results from the two methods are combined smoothly using a tangent hyperbolic function according to wavelengths and wave headings. The coefficients constituting the function are tuned to minimize mean squared error between predictions and model experiments. Finally, the new Combined method is verified by full-scale measurements of a general cargo ship and a container ship, and it seems to give good agreement with measurements in all analysis areas, compared to existing semi-empirical methods. Especially, it showed better performance in estimating added wave resistance at high waves, resonance frequencies, arbitrary waves, and low speeds.},

  abstract = {NACRA 17 is a small foiling catamaran used in Olympic sailing. Sailing in the NACRA 17 is truly unsteady, especially in the foiling conditions. Dynamic velocity prediction has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to the unsteady nature of foiling sailboats. Different approaches have been applied to predict the motions of foiling or skimming boats in unsteady conditions. Typically, the aerodynamic forces are computed by the quasi-steady theory assumption. Static coefficients are used, and the applied velocities are corrected with boat motions. The hydrodynamic forces of a fully foiling boat can be computed in a similar fashion, but this method fails to include the effect of changes in the free surface as well as added mass. This paper proposes an approach where dynamic coefficients of the NACRA 17 hydrofoils are determined based on unsteady Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with a free surface. In the simulations the foil is moved in prescribed motions in one degree of freedom (DOF) at a time and dynamic coefficients are extracted for different frequencies of motion. All coefficients are combined in a coupled system of equations, and the equations can be solved in 6 DOFs in the time domain. Test scenarios with time-varying conditions are simulated and compared with full dynamic CFD simulations. The initial investigation of the approach shows promising results, but more investigations are needed to validate the approach and to identify possible limitations.},

The no-slip condition used for the viscous flow realizes the shock-free condition for pressure around the trailing edge, which proves to be an advantage of the present numerical simulation over the potential method where Kutta condition is imposed. Through the numerical computation, it is found that the lift and drag are seriously influencd by the free-surface waves which are affected greatly by the submergence depth and angle of attack. The large-amplitude waves, under the suspect of breaking, have much influence on the lift and drag forces because the pressure fields are seriously affected by the waves. The righting moment, which comes from the non-symmetrical lift distribution along the span, is also calculated for the heeled case.},

Based on the model experimental tests of 11 ships in regular head waves, the new formulas have more flexible forms and can better fit the test results than other similar models. In addition, this model proposes a significant wave height based correction factor multiplied to the conventional integration to compute wave resistance in irregular waves. This factor is supposed to consider the impact of coupled ship motions in high waves on a ship's added resistance due to waves. The model is validated by the full-scale measurement from two vessels, a PCTC and a chemical tanker. The encountered weather conditions along the sailing routes are extracted from the reanalysis metocean data. The results indicate that the proposed model can provide quite accurate predictions of ship speed loss in head sea operations.},

Normally a multi-dimensional matrix of CFD results is pre-computed and forces and moments obtained by interpolation during a VPP execution. A more exact technique is to use the CFD code itself as a VPP, i.e. to simultaneously integrate the flow and rigid body equations in time. In the present paper a technique of this coupled type is introduced. An initial guess is required for speed and attitude, and by time integration in six degrees of freedom this guess is corrected to a steady state solution. Three phases are identified. First the attitude is kept constant over a period of time to stabilize the flow. Thereafter the different degrees of freedom are released successively and the rudder activated to achieve yaw balance. Finally, in the converged phase, the net forces and moments are zero in all degrees of freedom and the results reported. The performance prediction is carried out for a dinghy and a large high-performance racing yacht. Convergence of all variables is demonstrated and the results used for finding the optimum speed to windward and downwind. Details of the numerical setup are reported.},

  abstract = {Design and manufacturing technologies have promoted the use of composites in hydrodynamic lifting surfaces. Composites, even with state-of-the-art coatings, are susceptible to cavitation erosion damage. This work aims to design a cavitation-free composite lifting surface to maximize efficiency while ensuring structural integrity. We optimize a canonical hydrofoil using a gradient-based optimization framework that couples a Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes solver with a finite-element structural solver. The optimization reduces the weighted drag coefficient by 1.2\% over lift coefficients between 0.2 and 0.6, and increases the cavitation inception speed by 82\% at the nominal condition compared to the baseline. The optimized design shows higher cavitation inception speeds than an Eppler hydrofoil (E1127, known for cavitation-free operation at moderate lift conditions) with the same baseline planform at CL{$\geq$}0.2. The improvement from the E1127 hydrofoil was due mostly to delaying tip vortex cavitation induced by 3-D effects. The optimization finds the fiber angle to balance the bend-twist coupling and modifies the directional strength to reduce the susceptibility to excessive deformation and material failure when sweep presents.},

High-fidelity simulations are necessary to capture critical physics near these regions, such as separation, junction vortices, and cavitation. We present RANS-based hydrodynamic optimizations of a T-shaped hydrofoil, including changes in the junction geometry. The optimized hydrofoils avoid separation and delay cavitation compared to the baseline. The full optimization design with planform, cross-section, and junction geometry variables yields a total drag reduction of 6.4\%. The optimized results show that the relative locations of the maximum foil thickness and the maximum strut thickness significantly impact the junction cavitation. Including the translation between the strut and the foil and more strut geometric variables as design variables will provide further improvement. The comparison between optimized designs demonstrates that optimizing planform and detailed junction geometry provides further improvement in addition to designing the cross-sectional geometry. The hydrostructural analyses show that the optimized T-foils have lower stress at the junction than the baseline because of the resultant junction fairing. However, these hydrodynamic-only optimized T-foils have higher deformation and maximum stress, which could result in accelerated fatigue, highlighting the need for hydrostructural responses in design optimization. The results demonstrate that the developed methodology is useful for designing next-generation complex hydrodynamic lifting surfaces.},

However, composite lifting surfaces are often constructed with a large number of layers of fiber-reinforced polymers to sustain various loading conditions, prevent crack propagation, and improve reliability. Hence, the first objective of this paper is to investigate how an optimized equivalent single-layer unidirectional carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) hydrofoil differs from a multi-layer design. In addition, the complex, multi-scale, and load-dependent failure mechanisms lead to uncertainties in the material failure initiation. Hence, our second objective is to investigate how material failure initiation criteria affect the optimized designs. We conducted four high-fidelity hydrostructural optimizations: two equivalent single-layer unidirectional CFRP hydrofoils and two multi-layer CFRP hydrofoils. For each configuration, two hydrofoils are optimized using different failure initiation criteria. The comparisons show that the optimized hydrofoils achieve similar optimized geometry and hydrodynamic performance metrics (drag and cavitation inception). However, varying fiber orientations across the layers allows more precise optimization of the structural stiffness and strengths to leverage material anisotropy, achieving higher performance. The two implemented failure criteria provide a similarly conservative failure initiation estimate (due to the safety factor of three) and therefore result in similar designs.},

For the added resistance due to diffraction effect, we updated Faltinsen et al.'s (1980) asymptotic approach and introduced several semi-empirical parameters to approximate the added resistance in waves of various headings. The limited ship draft effect is examined analytically, while the hull form effects are taken into account empirically by regression of available data. For the radiation effect, the maximum value of added resistance and the corresponding wavelength for the various wave headings are determined by regression analysis of the experimental data. The developed formula is verified by application to typical ship types and sizes, both in the design and ballast conditions, at both design and low speeds. An error analysis for the various tested scenarios shows that the performance of the developed formula is satisfactory.},

It has been shownby Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associatedquantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the averagequantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quantization schemesfor 26 quanta, b = 1,2, t ,7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

  abstract = {Voyage optimization is a practice to select the optimum route for the ship operators to increase energy efficiency and reduce Green House Gas emission in the shipping industry. An accurate prediction of ship operational performance is the prerequisite to achieve these targets. In this paper, a modified Kwon׳s method was developed to predict the added resistance caused by wave and wind for a specific ship type, and an easy-to-use semi-empirical ship operational performance prediction model is proposed. It can accurately predict the ship׳s operational performance for a specific commercial ship under different drafts, at varying speeds and in varying encounter angles, and then enables the user to investigate the relation between fuel consumption and the various sea states and directions that the ship may encounter during her voyage. Based on the results from the operational performance prediction model and real time climatological information, different options for the ship׳s navigation course can be evaluated according to a number of objectives, including: maximizing safety and minimizing fuel consumption and voyage time. By incorporating this into a decision support tool, the ship׳s crew are able to make an informed decision about what is the best course to navigate. In this study the Energy Efficiency of Operation (EEO) is defined as an indicator to illustrate the ratio of main engine fuel consumption per unit of transport work. Two case studies are carried out to perform the prediction of ship operational performance for Suezmax and Aframax Oil Tankers, and the results indicate that the semi-empirical ship operational performance prediction model provides extremely quick calculation with very reasonable accuracy, particularly considering the uncertainties related to the parameters of interest for the case study data. Within the case studies, the additional fuel consumption caused by the combined hull and propeller fouling and engine degradation is included in the model as a time-dependent correction factor. The factor may assist the ship owner/operator to determine the hull coating selection, and/or the dry-docking and main engine maintenance strategy.},

The total resistance is calculated by the Rankine source panel method and the empirical formula which agrees well with the corresponding experimental data and further acquires validation with the overall error of 2.0{\textbackslash}\%. Accordingly, the ship forepart and stern form have been optimized under conditions of the single design speed and whole speeds range based on the considerations of generally distributed and variable operational speeds for the operating characteristics of modern container ships synchronously. The optimized result presents well-balanced drag reduction benefits which averagely remain above 4.0{\textbackslash}\% of ship resistance decrease.

However, simply solving these equations is not sufficient to be able to perform efficient design optimization with a flow solver in the loop. This paper discusses the recommendations for developing a flow solver that is suitable for efficient aerodynamic and multidisciplinary design optimization. One of the major recommendations is to be able to load the flow solver as a library that provides direct memory access to the relevant data. Other recommendations are to use a higher-level language for scripting and to pay special attention to solution warm starting, code efficiency, flow solver robustness, and solution failure handling. As an example of a flow solver that follows these recommendations, the open-source flow solver ADflow is presented. Results from aerodynamic optimization, aerostructural analysis, and aerostructural optimization using ADflow demonstrate the performance advantages claimed in the recommendations. The publication of these recommendations and the availability of the source code open the door for other solvers to adopt the same application programming interface. ADflow is part of a wider aerodynamic shape optimization tool suite that is also available under an open-source license.},

  abstract = {Antony Jameson pioneered CFD-based aerodynamic design optimization in the late 1980s. In addition to developing the fundamental theory, Jameson implemented that theory in codes that were practical enough to be used in industry. As a result of Jameson's seminal efforts, a research community has been established in aerodynamic design optimization. This research area has experienced sustained improvements in CFD solvers, mesh deformation, sensitivity computation, and optimization tools. We review recent developments for each of these components and present open-source tools available for aerodynamic shape optimization. A variety of applications is presented, including the optimization of a supercritical airfoil starting from a circle, a web application that optimizes airfoils within a few seconds, aircraft aerodynamic and aerostructural optimization, and aeropropulsive optimization. We also review the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group (ADODG) benchmarks and other aerodynamic shape optimization problems. Among the ADODG benchmarks, we focus on the RANS-based problems and discuss some of the issues encountered, including comparing Euler and RANS results and design-space multimodality. The availability of these benchmarks and the open-source tools is expected to enable further studies and benchmarks in CFD-based aerodynamic design optimization and MDO.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model for the tacking maneuver of a sailing yacht is presented as an extension of research by the same authors. The authors have proposed the equations of motion for the tacking maneuver expressed in the horizontal body axis system. The calculation method was applied to a 34-foot sailing cruiser and the simulated result showed good agreement with the measured data from full-scale tests; however, the modeling of aerodynamic force variation during tacking was insufficient due to lack of information about the sail forces. In this report, the authors performed full-scale measurement of sail forces during tacking maneuvers using a sail dynamometer boat Fujin. The Fujin is a 34-foot sailing cruiser which has a measurement system to obtain simultaneously sail forces, sail shapes, and boat attitude. Based on the results of full-scale measurements, a new model of aerodynamic force variation for the tacking maneuver was proposed. The equations of motion were also simplified to more easily perform the numerical simulation. Using this calculation method, the tacking simulations were performed and compared with the measured data from three full-scale boats. The simulated results showed good agreement with the measured data. This simulation method provides an effective means for assessment of tacking performance of general sailing yachts.},

The model is set up to assist NC Raceboats with the VPP based hydrofoil design, considering the sailing performance in three modes: displacement, transition and hydrofoil. The yacht is a lightweight monohull designed for light wind conditions with up to five crew members. The design includes a self-stabilizing hydrofoil configuration and an elevator rudder. The software tool, which is used for the velocity prediction program, is FS-Equilibrium, developed by DNV. The software offers a modular workbench in which each force can be modelled with semi-empirical force modules, which are based on validated methods and theories. The performance prediction is interpreted and discussed: as foreseen, the performance of the high-performance lake racer in hydrofoiling condition is significantly improved compared to its assessment in displacement sailing mode. In medium breeze conditions, the yacht is able to lift up on its hydrofoils and attain flight mode. The minimum hydrofoiling speed investigation demonstrates that the VPP is able to consistently iterate Through the transition mode. This paper shows that it is possible to develop a VPP model for a hydrofoiling sailing yacht on the basis of relatively simple assumptions and theories.},

The development of a simplified panel method, which is based on thin ship theory, and the validation of the associated code for the prediction of the calm water resistance of twin-hull vessels is presented. The method was applied in the multi-objective optimisation of a fast, zero-emission, battery-driven catamaran by a genetic algorithm, while considering the ensuing design constraints, such as battery weight and space requirements. Results of the study were compared with resistance predictions from an advanced, non-linear Rankine panel method. Moreover, surrogate models for the approximation of the individual objective functions were implemented to speed up the optimisation process involving several hundred parametrically generated designs. Obtained results were also validated against results of a viscous CFD solver and showed great potential for the use of the proposed modified thin ship theory in connection with empirical corrections in the field of resistance prediction and hull form optimisation of fast catamarans and of slender hulls in general.},

In this respect, the calibration of the formula's parameter vector is conducted based on particle swarm optimization as well as a database of model test results comprising 25 different ships and around 1100 samples. In the first iteration, the minimization of reducible systematic uncertainty is of interest and the effect of four objective functions on prediction accuracy is evaluated. Moreover, two different parameter combinations were obtained for blunt (CB{$\geq$}0.70) and slender-type ships. Conversely, the irreducible statistical uncertainty, i.e. the inherent noise of the experimental data, is taken into account by a quantile regression procedure. Applying this approach, a 90\% prediction interval for the formula's estimates is implemented using the skewed version of the superior loss function in the previous iteration. The practical relevance of an uncertainty estimate for the prediction of the added resistance is emphasized in the final part, in which the proposed approach is validated in regular waves against model test data and other well-established prediction methods. In general, the validation studies suggest satisfactory performance and reliability of the adapted semi-empirical formulation.},

  abstract = {The following report deals with the air forces on a biplane cellule. The first part deals with the two-dimensional problem neglecting viscosity. For the first time a method is employed which takes the properties of the wing section into consideration. The variation of the section, chord, gap, stagger, and decalage are investigated, a great number of examples are calculated and all numerical results are given in tables. For the biplane without stagger it is found that the loss of lift in consequence of the mutual influence of the two wing sections is only half as much if the lift is produced by the curvature of the section, as it is when the lift is produced by the inclination of the chord to the direction of motion. The second part deals with the influence of the lateral dimensions. This has been treated in former papers of the author, but the investigation of the staggered biplane is new. It is found that the h)ss of lift due to induction is almost unchanged whether the biplane is staggered or not. The third part is intended for practical use and can be read without knowledge of the first and second parts. The conclusions from the previous investigations are drawn, viscosity and experimental experience are brought in, and the method is simplified for practical application. Simple formulas give the drag, lift, and moment. In order to make the use of the simple formulas still more convenient, tables for the dynamical pressure, induced drag, and angle are added, so that practically no computation is needed for the application of the results.},

The book is solidly based on fundamentals, but it also guides the student to an understanding of engineering applications through its consideration of realistic configurations. The book takes a balanced approach between theory and empirics, providing the necessary theoretical background for an intelligent evaluation and application of empirical procedures. It also serves as an introduction to more specialized research methods. It unifies the seemingly diverse problems of marine hydrodynamics by examining them not as separate problems but as related applications of the general field of hydrodynamics. The book evolved from a first-year graduate course in MIT's Department of Ocean Engineering. A knowledge of advanced calculus is assumed. Students will find a previous introductory course in fluid dynamics helpful, but the book presents the necessary fundamentals in a self-contained manner.

  abstract = {The use of hydrofoils as a means to improve ship performance raises the scientific issue of free-surface proximity, which must be considered in the design stage to feed velocity prediction programs, for instance. When predicting performance, it is convenient, for a selected accuracy level, to minimize the computational cost of models. Therefore, the present paper investigates the reliability of estimating the hydrodynamic characteristics of 3D wings using 2D simulations. In particular, the influence of aspect ratio on the hydrodynamic characteristics of shallowly-submerged hydrofoils under different operating conditions is addressed. For this purpose, rectangular wings (H105 profile at 2 deg angle of attack) of an aspect ratio between 4 and 20 are systematically analyzed using a 3D boundary element method. The free surface is modeled using a linearized Neumann-Kelvin condition. For the three chord-based Froude numbers studied (Frc = 0.5, Frc = 1.1, and Frc = 6.3), the submergence depth is swept between 0.1 and 30 times the foil chord. The trend of the hydrodynamic forces with respect to foil immersion for each Froude number is discussed in detail. The convergence of lift and drag with an increase in aspect ratio is observed. It is identified that the latter is accelerated with free-surface proximity at Frc = 6.3, suggesting the existence of a relationship between the depth of immersion and the speed of convergence. All in all, this work validates the application of steady boundary element methods for simulating the flow around a hydrofoil wing in the vicinity of the free surface and lays the foundations for an extensive study of the influence of geometrical parameters on hydrofoil performance.},

  abstract = {The use of hydrofoils to enhance ship performance raises the scientific issue of free-surface proximity, which is important to consider during the design stage, to feed velocity prediction programs, for instance. Typically, the flow over a shallowly submerged hydrofoil is characterized by the Froude number, the submergence depth-to-chord ratio, the angle of attack, and geometric parameters of the lifting surface. Among these parameters, the present paper investigates the influence of the wing aspect ratio on the lift and drag coefficients of hydrofoils operating near a free surface. For this purpose, rectangular wings with an H105 profile at 2{$^\circ$} angle of attack and aspect ratios ranging from 4 to 20 are systematically analyzed using a 3D boundary element method. The free surface is modeled using a linearized Neumann-Kelvin boundary condition. Chord-based Froude numbers of 0.5, 1.1, and 6.3 are studied. The submersion depth is swept between 0.1 and 30 times the foil chord length. The evolution of the normalized lift and drag coefficients with respect to the foil submersion and the aspect ratio is discussed in detail. Flow velocity is shown to play a significant role in the evolution of the lift and drag coefficients with submersion depth, close to the free surface, for all the aspect ratios. Its influence gets reduced by moving away from the free surface. The critical submersion depth, where the free-surface effects cease, is found to increase with higher flow velocity and aspect ratio. Furthermore, both positive and negative correlations between the force coefficients and the aspect ratio are identified, depending on the operating conditions. It is found that when the proximity to the free surface either enhances or impairs a force coefficient relative to its value in unbounded flow, increasing the aspect ratio amplifies this effect. Overall, this study confirms the effectiveness of steady boundary element methods for simulating the flow around hydrofoil wings in the vicinity of a free surface and contributes to further understanding the influence of geometric parameters on hydrofoil performance.},

  abstract = {The article herein presents a statistical calibration study of the approximate power method of Holtrop and Mennen focused on adapting the method to vessels characterized as "full" hull forms and low design and operating speeds and, thus, low Froude numbers. The fitting of the method is done by adjusting the constants, coefficients, and components of the method's equations by a systematic variation process controlled by genetic algorithms. The database that the method is calibrated against is consisted by model test results from modern (built between 2010 and 2016) bulk carriers and tankers, the KVLCC2, and the method follows a multistage approach, calibrating first the model for the prediction of total resistance and applying the selfpropulsion equations afterward. The uncertainty of the new improved method is assessed and modeled with a nonlinear regression equation to enable the use of the calibrated method in the early ship design and optimization process.                            1. Introduction               One of the most important aspects of the design and study of vessels and ocean structures is the prediction of resistance and, thus, powering requirements for a range of operational speeds. Given the constant societal and legislative pressure for the reduction of the carbon footprint of shipping and maritime activities, the accurate and reliable powering prediction from an early stage and tightly integrated within the process itself as the respective optimization studies is imperative. Although towing tank model testing has been since early times the most reliable method for power predictions, because of its high cost and demand for a fixed and given geometry it can be used only in the basic design stage when the design parameters related to the vessel's hull geometry are fixed and serves as a final validation and benchmark to be used afterward in the conclusion of the shipbuilding process during sea trials. On the other hand, the last decade has seen the exponential growth of computational fluid dynamic solvers that solve Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations over the hull form in finite volume approaches (Schneekluth \& Bertram 1998; Specialist Committee on CFD 2014). Although originally the computational cost was penalizing its application in early design stages, the advances in computing hardware and software allowed the integration of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in the early ship hull form design and optimization (Specialist Committee on CFD 2014). Such methods, however, can be used in applications where variables such as the principal particulars have been fixed or have a small variance, with the focus being on the variation in local geometry and topological characteristics that have a significant effect on local flow phenomena (Specialist Committee on CFD 2014). However, when the application in question is a global optimization study, where there is a large variance in principal particulars (vessel's dimensions) and structural and cargo arrangements, there is an apparent need for a large number of optimization variants and, thus, evaluations (usually in the order of thousands). The application of CFD in such cases is impractical as the optimization algorithm will eventually require hundreds of thousands computational hours even in high-performance computers; therefore, empirical or statistical methods are better suited. The most prominent of these is the approximate power prediction method by Holtrop and Mennen (1982) together with its revision (Holtrop 1984). Although this methodology provides sufficient accuracy, the statistical sample of the hull forms on which it is based dates back to the 1970s and 1980s. Such hulls, although roughly similar, have some distinct deviations from modern commercial vessels. In the article presented herein, the authors attempt to make a calibration of the Holtrop and Mennen methodology via a systematic variation with the use of genetic algorithms. The calibration is based on a statistical sample of model test results of low Froude number (Fn) full hull forms (with Cb greater than 0.7) of modern commercial bulk carriers and tankers, and its focus is on the integration of the new coefficients in a holistic methodology for the optimization of large bulk carriers.

The In- ternational Moth is a single-handed dinghy, which, while moving forward, uses two T-foils to lift the hull off the water. The DVPP model is developed on the basis of simple assumptions, semi-empirical methods and freely available input data. The benefit of this simplified model is its flexibility with regard to geometry and parameter changes. The model is validated by means of plausibility checks and in relation to observed real sailing conditions. Stability assessments are ini- tially carried out with the help of the small disturbance theory, by analysing the eigenvalues and modes of the linearised dynamic system. Then, the dynamic be- haviour of the non-linearised system faced with real perturbations, such as lulls, gusts and waves, is simulated to evaluate the stability of the International Moth. Finally, a basic sailing manoeuvre is implemented in the model and later sim- ulated. Using the simple DVPP model developed in this thesis, the realistic dy- namic behaviour of a hydrofoiling sailboat can be simulated over large parameter ranges and all relevant sailing conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract. For a sailing yacht, depowering is a set of strategies used to limit the sail force magnitude by intentionally moving away from the point of maximum forward driving force, potentially reducing the ship speed. The reasons for doing this includes among others; reduction of quasi-static heeling angle, structural integrity of masts and sails and crew comfort. For a wind powered cargo ship, time spent on a route is of utmost importance. This leads to the question whether there is a performance difference between different depowering strategies and if so, how large. In this research, a wind-powered cargo vessel with rigid wings is described in a Velocity Prediction Program (VPP) with four-degrees of freedom, namely surge, sway, roll and yaw, with a maximum heel angle constraint. The resulting ship speed performance for different depowering strategies are investigated and the implications in roll and pitch-moments are discussed. The wind conditions when depowering is needed are identified. A statistical analysis on the probability of occurrence of these conditions and the impact of the different depowering strategies on the required number of days for a round-trip on a Transatlantic route is performed.},

Iterative boundary element method is implemented to predict the flow field. This study aims to investigate the aspect ratio effect on the free surface interactions and hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoils under a free surface by using potential flow theory. Three different submergence depths and aspect ratios are studied in the wide range of Froude Numbers. In 3D cases, spanwise width of the numerical wave tank model is selected both equal and wider to the foil span, to observe the sidewall effects. Wave field seems to be two dimensional at low Froude numbers. On the other hand, signs of three dimensionalities are observed on the free surface structure for higher Fn, even the predicted wave elevations are very close to 2D calculations in the midsection. Increment in the Fn give a rise to the amplitude of the generated waves first, however a further increase in Fn has a lowering effect with the beginning of waves spill in the spanwise direction in the form of Kelvin waves. Free surface proximity and resultant wave field are also seeming to be linked with the lift force on the hydrofoil. As aspect ratio of the foil increase, 3D lift values are getting closer to those of 2D calculations. However, it is seen that, 3D BEM predictions of a hydrofoil under free surface effect cannot be considered two-dimensional even the aspect ratio is equal to 8.},

The last 3 America's Cups have been competed on hydro foiling vessels. Design programs such as Velocity Prediction Programs (VPP) have become a key asset to America's Cup teams to allow for the optimisation and testing of designs before manufacture. Presented is the development of a Six Degree-of-Freedom (6DoF) Quasi-Static Velocity Prediction Program (SVPP) and Dynamic Velocity Prediction Program (DVPP) for the 35th and 36th America's Cup foiling AC50 Catamaran and AC75 Monohull. The models have been validated against race data from the 35th and 36th America's Cup showing good correlation for a wide wind range of 8 to 22 knots. The paper presents how the AC50 SVPP was used for analysis on the impact of Rudder Rake Differential (RD) on overall performance, and predicting the optimal wind range for use of the light and heavy weather dagger boards on the AC50 Catamaran. The AC75 SVPP and DVPP were used to analyse the affect of hull shape and the main foils' fixed angle-of-attack (AOA) on time-to-fight and peak velocity to determine optimal foil setup and pitch angle when foiling. The SVPP and DVPP use XFLR5 software suite to model the foils. Experimental data for a T-foil tested in the Australian Maritime College towing tank facility has been used to predict viscous and free surface effect adjustments to the predictions from XFLR5.},

As a result, in contrast to some earlier studies, it is found that the "wetted width" associated with the added mass is not that of the intersection of the wedge with the undisturbed water surface, but the wetted width of the splashed-up water, as originally proposed by Wagner [(1932), Uber Stoss-und Gleitvorgange an der Oberflache von Flussig-Keiten, Zeitschrift flit Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik, Band 12, Heft 4 (August)]. However, the splash-up ratio is not the value of ( {\textasciitilde} / 2 - 1 ) which he proposed, but a value which decreases with increasing deadrise, originally proposed in the late-1940s by Pierson ("Pierson's hypothesis" in the paper). For 30{$^\circ$} deadrise, for example, Pierson's splash-up ratio is two-thirds that of Wagner's.},

  abstract = {Lifting hydrofoils are gaining importance, since they drastically reduce the wetted surface area of a ship hull, thus decreasing resistance. To attain efficient hydrofoils, the geometries can be obtained from an automated optimization process, based on simulations. However, hydrofoil high-fidelity simulations are computationally demanding, since fine meshes are needed to accurately capture the pressure field and the boundary layer on the hydrofoil. Simulation-based optimization can therefore be very expensive.  Automated surrogate models, trained by a limited number of simulations, can reduce the required computational demand for the optimization by performing simulations where these are more informative. Furthermore, if an efficient low-fidelity hydrofoil performance prediction tool (with a low computational cost) is available, using surrogates in a multi-fidelity framework can provide a further reduction in required simulations, by combining the accuracy of a few high-fidelity with an exploration process based on a larger number of low-fidelity computations. In this study, we propose a hydrofoil optimization procedure based on two simulation codes, a dedicated hydrofoil potential flow solver for low-fidelity simulations and a RANS solver for both medium-and high-fidelity simulations. The RANS solver uses adaptive grid refinement to attain high accuracy with a limited computational budget. Two different multi-fidelity frameworks are compared for a parameterized geometric model of a realistic hydrofoil: only RANS based and potential-RANS based. The effect of different combinations of fidelity levels on the efficiency of the optimization and the performance of the kitefoil-type hydrofoil is investigated and discussed.},

In the optimization process, three different algorithms have been tested, coupled together with a CFD flow solver. A perturbation surface has been used to modify the shape of the hull, allowing for a sharp reduction of the number of design variables. Accordingly, with different objective functions and geometrical constraints, several new optimized shapes of the bulb of a tanker ship have been automatically obtained.

This paper represents an attempt of applying a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) procedure to the enhancement of the performances of an existing ship. At the present stage the work involves modeling, development, and implementation of algorithms only for the hydrodynamic optimization.

This work presents numerical simulations of a 2D hydrofoil section NACA0012 at 5{$^\circ$} angle of attack in the vicinity of the free-surface, for different values of the submergence depth, for a chord-based Froude number of 0.571 and a Reynolds number of 159,000. Unsteady-Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations are solved with a mixture model to capture the free surface (Volume Of Fluid method), and using an automatic grid refinement. Verification of the numerical model and validation with data from the literature are presented. Deformation of the free surface and alteration of the hydrodynamic forces compared to the deep immersion case are observed for a submergence depth-to-chord ratio ℎ/{$c$} lower than 2. The foil drag increases up to more than three times the infinite-depth value at ℎ/{$c\approx$}0.5. The lift force slightly increases until ℎ/{$c$} around 1, and then decreases sharply. For ℎ/{$c\&$}lt;0.5, the pressure field around the foil is totally modified and the lift is swapped to downward.

Over the important range of frequencies that define the total variance of the spectrum within a few per cent, the transformed plots yield a nondimensional spectral form that is nearly the same over this entire range of wind speeds within the present accuracies of the data. However, since slight variations of the wind speed have large effects on the location of this nondimensional spectral form, inaccuracies in the determination of the wind speed at sea allow for some latitude in the final choice of the form of the spectrum. Also, since the winds used to obtain the nondimensional form were measured at a height greater than 10 meters, the problem of relating the spectral form to a standard anemometer height arises. The variability introduced by this factor needs to be considered. The results, when errors in the wind speed, the sampling variability of the data, and the anemometer heights are considered, suggest a spectral form that is a compromise between the various proposed spectrums and that has features similar to many of them. A spectral form is recommended for tentative application to the problem of wave forecasting by spectral techniques. Improved wind speed measurements (taken at several elevations and averaged over longer time intervals) and better wave data (taken for longer time intervals and analyzed so as to better fit the procedures) are needed so that the form of the spectrums of fully developed wind seas and seas limited by either fetch or duration can be determined with even greater precision.},

The present research was based on multiple perturbed simulations of the turning, zigzag and spiral manoeuvres. A salient feature of the present study is that the perturbations were applied to the total hydrodynamic forces and moments as well as separately to their characteristic parts, i.e., to the linear and nonlinear single-variable and coupled components. Another special feature is that the deviations of the perturbated responses were estimated not only considering the standard manoeuvring performance indices, but also through application of the Euclidean metric directly to the time histories and to the spiral curve. The performed analysis permitted the sensitivity of the model to be traced to various parameters and groups thereof. It was established that the highest sensitivity of the model was to linear and some nonlinear multivariable parameters, and the Euclidean metric permitted a more detailed analysis than that based only on standard discrete manoeuvring indices. The obtained results are expected to be useful in the application of system identification methods to typical inherently stable fast surface-displacement ships.},

In hydrofoil design for sailing yachts, surrogate models can be used both for automatic shape optimisation of the foil and for performance evaluation of the entire yacht in the context of a VPP, as a response surface. We present an adaptive method for the construction of surrogate models which can be used for both these objectives, with a simple change of parameters. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) is used for the data fitting, while the adaptive choice of sample points is based either on the GPR variance or on a combination with a cross-validation error estimation. A first test on analytical functions shows that the cross-validation approach is superior for response surface creation, while both adaptation methods are equally suited for shape optimisation. A second test on the shape optimisation of a two-dimensional hydrofoil indicates that for moderate immersion depths, the optimum shape is not sensible to the distance to the free surface.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents a practical hydrodynamic optimization framework for hydrofoil shape design. Automated simulation based optimization of hydrofoil is a challenging process. It may involve conflicting optimization objectives, but also impose a trade-off between the cost of numerical simulations and the limited budgets available for ship design. The optimization frameworkis based on sequential sampling and surrogate modeling. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is used to build a predictive model based on data issued from fluid simulations of selected hydrofoil geometries. The GPR model is then combined with other criteria into an acquisition function that isevaluated over the design space, to define new querypoints that are added to the data set in order to improve the model. A custom acquisition function is developed, based on GPR variance and cross validation of the data.A hydrofoil geometric modeler is also developed to automatically create the hydrofoil shapes based on the parameters determined by the optimizer. To complete the optimization loop, FINE/Marine, a RANS flow solver, is embedded into the framework to perform the fluid simulations. Optimization capabilities are tested on analytical test cases. The results show that the custom function is more robust than other existing acquisition functions when tested on difficult functions. The entire optimization framework is then tested on 2D hydrofoil sections and 3D hydrofoil optimization cases with free surface. In both cases, the optimization process performs well, resulting in optimized hydrofoil shapes and confirming the results obtained from the analytical test cases. However, the optimum is shown to be sensitive to operating conditions.},

  abstract = {Static Velocity Prediction Programs (VPP) are standard tools in sailing yachts' design and performance assessment. Predicting the maximal steady velocity of a yacht involves resolving constrained optimization problems. These problems have a prohibitive computational cost when using high-fidelity global modeling of the yacht. This difficulty has motivated the introduction of modular approaches, decomposing the global model into subsystems modeled independently and approximated by surrogate models (response surfaces). The maximum boat speed for prescribed conditions solves an optimization problem for the trimming parameters of the model constrained by compatibility conditions between the subsystems' surrogate solution (e.g., the yacht equilibrium). The accuracy of the surrogates is then critical for the quality of the resulting VPP. This paper relies on Gaussian Process (GP) models of the subsystems and introduces an original sequential Active Learning Method (ALM) for their joint construction. Our ALM exploits the probabilistic nature of the GP models to decide the enrichment of the training sets using an infilling criterion that combines the predictive uncertainty of the surrogate models and the likelihood of equilibrium at every input point. The resulting strategy enables the concentration of the computational effort around the manifolds where equilibrium is satisfied. The results presented compare ALM with a standard (uninformed) Quasi-Monte Carlo method, which samples the input space of the subsystems uniformly. ALM surrogates have higher accuracy in the equilibrium regions for equal construction cost, with improved mean prediction and reduced prediction uncertainty. We further investigate the effect of the prediction uncertainty on the numerical VPP and in a routing problem.},

The present project deals with the development of a six degree of freedom (DoF) Performance Prediction Program (PPP) for wind-assisted cargo ships aimed at contributing knowledge on WAPS performance. It is a fast and easy tool, able to predict the performance of any commercial ship with three possible different WAPS installed: rotor sails, rigid wing sails and DynaRigs; with only the ship main particulars and general dimensions as input data. The tool is based on semi-empirical methods and a WAPS aerodynamic database created from published data on lift and drag coefficients, which can be interpolated with the aim to scale to different sizes and configurations. A model validation is carried out to evaluate its reliability. The results are compared with the real sailing data of a Long Range 2 (LR2) class wind-assisted tanker vessel, the Maersk Pelican. The study indicates that the PPP shows good agreement with the technology suppliers' own modelling tool and reasonable agreement with the trends of the real sailing measurements. However, for downwind sailing conditions, the predictions are more conservative than the measured values. Lastly, results showing and comparing power savings for the three different WAPS are presented. Rotor Sails are found to be the most efficient WAPS studied with a much higher potential of driving force generation per square meter of projected sail area.},

The AC75 sailboat presents many challenges to developing these optimal maneuvers due to its nonlinear, high-dimensional, and highly unstable dynamics. During the takeoff maneuver, the boat starts in the water with low speed (displacement mode) and increases its speed until it reaches steady-state foiling (the hull stays out of the water). We optimized the time for the boat's transitions from displacement mode to foiling mode while maximizing the projection of the velocity in the desired target direction (VMG). We used an adaptive control approach to obtain these optimal maneuvers, which involved using a high-fidelity sailboat simulator for data generation and Jacobian learning for optimization. The optimal solutions were subject to value and rate constraints based on the physical limitations of the actuators, as well as the constraints enforced by human (sailors) abilities to perform such maneuvers. The optimal takeoff maneuver had an average VMG of 7.42 [m s-1], the boat reached the desired takeoff velocity in 14.8 [s] and completed the entire maneuver in 36.4 [s].

  abstract = {This research focuses on the development of optimal sailing maneuvers for an AC75 foiling sailboat competing in the America's Cup. The America's Cup is the oldest, most prestigious, and technologically advanced sailboat racing competition in the world. Each iteration brings new and innovative sailboat designs which drastically improve sailing performance but increase complexity in the control of the sailboat system. This added complexity in the design and operation of the  AC75  sailboat presents many challenges to the development of optimal sailing maneuvers. These challenges arise from the introduction of extra degrees of freedom and articulations in the boat such as the canting mechanisms (hydrofoils), which result in complex dynamical behaviors. The sailboat system is nonlinear, high-dimensional, and highly unstable. These complex characteristics require the development of high-order models, which are often intractable, or which introduce significant delays making them not well-suited for real-time control. The optimal maneuvers were achieved via the exploration of out-of-the-box solutions through data-driven controls and optimization. We used a high-fidelity sailboat simulator for the data generation process, and data-driven optimization schemes, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Extremum Seeking Control (ESC), and Jacobian Learning (JL) to optimize the sailing maneuvers. The optimizations were performed separately on various sailing maneuvers including close-hauled, tacking, and takeoff, as well as combinations of these maneuvers as performed during a race. The close-hauled and tacking maneuvers were optimized to achieve maximum Velocity Made Good (VMG) and minimum loss of VMG, respectively. The takeoff maneuver was optimized for maximum VMG and minimum time for the boat's transitions from displacement mode to foiling mode. The optimal solutions are subject to physical constraints and operational constraints enforced by the humans (sailors) in the loop. These maneuvers were developed for various heading angles (True Wind Angle (TWA)) and environmental conditions, such as True Wind Speed (TWS). Additionally, we performed an in-depth analysis of the optimal parameter settings obtained for close-hauled sailing to discern general trends in the parameter space. The trend of optimal parameters versus the wind direction provides a good understanding of the parameter space for varying sailing directions which can help guide the sailor's decisions during a race. The results show how optimization and controls can play a significant role in the development of advisory systems for complex human-operated systems. Lastly, the maneuvers developed in this search serve as performance benchmarks and provide insightful information about the underlying dynamics of the boat.},

The motion of the sailing boat upward is studied by computing the horizontal acceleration at each time step and then deducing the velocity and position of the boat. The heel balance is performed in a very simplified model: the aerodynamic rolling moment on the sails is balanced by static moments, due to the keel mass and the crew one, assumed to be located at a certain distance of the symmetry plane of the boat. Different options of these calculations are available: the heel angle is fixed and the weight of the crew located on one side of the boat can vary; it is also possible to give a maximum value to this crew mass and let a free heel angle; the last option is to let a fixed crew weight and free heel angle.

  abstract = {During the design phase of a high performance sailing yacht, naval architects use tools such as VPPs (Velocity Prediction Programs). A VPP solves the equations of motion of the boat using hydrodynamic and aerodynamic force models and allows determination of the speed and the attitude of a sailing yacht. Solving the equations of motion is relatively simple but estimating aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces is more complex and extremely costly since each boat configuration requires a set of forces that may be derived from more or less accurate empirical, numerical or experimental methods. In general at the beginning of the design phase, architects use empirical methods (quick but not so accurate) to obtain a first result. Then the databases are enriched using computed and/or experimental data around the operating points estimated by the empirical method. Recent developments in RANSE based CFD software FINE™/Marine enable us to reduce the number of steps in performing complete modelling of a sailing yacht in motion. The software is able to simulate the speed and the attitude of a sailing boat by solving the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations with free surface in 6 DOF (here 5 solved DOF with an imposed zero yaw motion) and by towing the vessel using an aerodynamic wrench computed by the software ARAVANTI. Both air and water flow fields are solved with the help of an Interface Capturing Method. Thus, the boat accelerates and adopts an attitude (angle, drift, trim and sink) and a speed that balance hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces. This development is part of a long term collaboration aiming at modelling a full scale boat in motion subject to hydro and aero-elastic forces. As an illustration, a validation campaign on calm water of the RANSE code and recent results obtained with this new type of VPP applied to an AC 90 boat type will be presented.},

  abstract = {Robust optimization strategies typically aim at minimizing some statistics of the uncertain objective function and can be expensive to solve when the statistic is costly to estimate at each design point. Surrogate models of the uncertain objective function can be used to reduce this computational cost. However, such surrogate approaches classically require a low-dimensional parametrization of the uncertainties, limiting their applicability. This work concentrates on the minimization of the quantile and the direct construction of a quantile regression model over the design space, from a limited number of training samples. A Bayesian quantile regression procedure is employed to construct the full posterior distribution of the quantile model. Sampling this distribution, we can assess the estimation error and adjust the complexity of the regression model to the available data. The Bayesian regression is embedded in a Bayesian optimization procedure, which generates sequentially new samples to improve the determination of the minimum of the quantile. Specifically, the sample infill strategy uses optimal points of a sample set of the quantile estimator. The optimization method is tested on simple analytical functions to demonstrate its convergence to the global optimum. The robust design of an airfoil's shock control bump under high-dimensional geometrical and operational uncertainties serves to demonstrate the capability of the method to handle problems with industrial relevance. Finally, we provide recommendations for future developments and improvements of the method.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the use of constrained surrogate models to solve the multi-design optimization problem of a flexible hydrofoil. The surrogate-based optimization (EGO) substitutes the complex objective function of the problem by an easily evaluable model, constructed from a limited number of computations at carefully selected design points. Associated with ad-hoc statistical strategies to propose optimum candidates within the estimated feasible domain, EGO enables the resolution of complex optimization problems. In this work, we rely on Gaussian processes (GP) to model the objective function and adopt a probabilistic classification method to treat non-explicit inequality constraints and non-explicit representation of the feasible domain. This procedure is applied to the design of the shape and the elastic characteristics of a hydrofoil equipped with deformable elements providing flexibility to the trailing edge. The optimization concerns the minimization of the hydrofoil drag while ensuring a non-cavitating flow, at selected sailing conditions (boat speed and lifting force). The drag value and cavitation criterion are determined by solving a two-dimensional nonlinear fluid-structure interaction problem, based on a static vortex lattice method with viscous boundary layer equations, for the flow, and a nonlinear elasticity solver for the deformations of the elastic components of the foil. We compare the optimized flexible hydrofoil with a rigid foil geometrically optimized for the same sailing conditions. This comparison highlights the hydrodynamical advantages brought by the flexibility: a reduction of the drag over a large range of boat speeds, less susceptibility to cavitation and a smaller angle of attack tuning range.},

Compared with other methods on reducing the fuel consumption, such as optimizing the design of hull lines or ship propulsion system, setting additional energy saving device, the voyage optimization is a way which is easier to implement and needs less investment cost. In this paper, an integrated simulation model of ship propulsion and maneuvering system is established and verified. Then, a benchmark 38800~t cargo ship and a 32n miles coastal service are selected for the case study. Based on the ship operating characteristic and voyage environments, 24 representative cases of combination about the voyage set up and ship control modes are proposed. The ship fuel consumptions under 24 cases are calculated using the integrated simulation model. Finally, fuel consumption change under different conditions are analyzed and the most reasonable case of saving fuel consumption is provided. This study tries to investigate the influence of multiple factors on the ship fuel consumption considering the realistic and representative operating conditions, and provides theoretical suggestions for ship propulsion and maneuvering control, voyage planning and engine management for reducing fuel consumption over ship voyages.},

The design method is applied to develop a series of nonsymmetrical hydrofoil sections having a minimum pressure bucket whose depth and width are adapted to practical applications. Its depth, namely, the bottom value of --- Cpmin, is made as low as necessary to achieve a certain critical cavitation speed; its width is made as large as possible to tolerate fluctuations of large angles of attack. Hydrodynamic properties of these newly developed hydrofoil sections are compared with those of NACA 16 and NACA 66 (MOD). The ability to achieve significant delay in cavitation inception makes the present design method useful when applying it to hydrofoils as well as to marine propellers.}

The optimization is formulated as a single-objective, single-point problem with both geometrical and operational constraints. The latter also considers seakeeping performance at multiple conditions. A surrogate model is used, based on stochastic radial basis functions with lower confidence bounding, as a supervised active learning approach. Furthermore, a multi-fidelity formulation, leveraging on unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes equations and potential flow solvers, is used in order to reduce the computational cost of the SDDO procedure. Exploring a five-dimensional design space based on free-form deformation under limited computational resources, the optimal configuration achieves a resistance reduction of about 3\% at the escape speed and about 6.4\% on average over the operational speed range.},

  abstract = {The increasing economic cost and environmental impact of maritime transportation necessitate the reduction of fossil fuel consumption of ocean-going cargo ships. Although fundamental ship propulsion system theory is well-known and is at a mature stage of development, there is still an enormous variety in the assessment methodology of (environmental) transport performance of ships. Furthermore, calibration of ship propulsion system model parameters with testbed, towing tank and full-scale measurement data is rare, as these measurements are both difficult and expensive. Finally, the effects of different power management strategies on the ultimate energy conversion effectiveness of typical cargo ships have rarely been investigated systematically. In this paper these three issues are discussed, addressed and solved for a representative benchmark chemical tanker. This ship was chosen to investigate the so-called energy conversion effectiveness under various propulsion control and electric power generation modes, as ample real ship data is available. The transport performance assessment of the ship's power plant is generalised for hybrid arrangements with either Power-Take-Off or Power-Take-In. The results show that an optimal combination of propulsion control, power management and voyage planning will further reduce the global fuel consumption and CO2 emissions produced by the shipping industry.},

This paper tries to fill the knowledge gap by investigating the influence of the ship mission profile, propulsion modes and effects of different fuels on the fuel consumption and emissions of the ship over the whole voyage, including transit in open sea and manoeuvring in close-to-port areas. Results show that propulsion control and electric power generation modes have a notable influence on the ship's fuel consumption and emissions during the voyage. During close-to-port manoeuvres, propelling the ship in power-take-in (PTI) mode and generating the electric power by auxiliary engines rather than the main engine will reduce the local NOx and HC (hydrocarbons) emissions significantly. Sailing the ship on LNG will reduce the fuel consumption, CO2 and NOx emissions notably while producing higher HC emissions than traditional fuels. The hybridisation of the ship propulsion and using LNG together with ship voyage optimisation, considering the ship mission, ship operations and sea conditions, will improve the ship's fuel consumption and emissions over the whole voyage significantly.},

  abstract = {The review covers a number of selected topics related to ship mathematical models used in ship manoeuvring, mainly for simulation purposes. The focus is given to relatively obscure or even sometimes misunderstood issues. A rather detailed analysis of the manoeuvring motion kinematics is given followed by discussion of various forms of dynamic equations and parametric representation of hydrodynamic forces. Spe-cial attention is given to comparative evaluation of methods for estimating manoeuvring model's parameters including application of optimal experimental designs to captive-model tests and various system identification techniques. Comments are given on the Munk method and cross-flow drag concept. Review of the most popular database methods for estimating manoeuvring derivatives is performed. Methods for practical estima-tion of forces on propellers and rudders are analysed. The review is concluded with brief comments on the numerical integration of equations of motion and on the code organization. 1 INTRODUCTION The theory of ship manoeuvrability was the last do-main of ship hydrodynamics and dynamics to emerge and to mature. The state of the art in this area as it was consolidated by the end of 30s is well exposed by Schoenherr (1939) in the first edition of the well known Principles of Naval Architecture (PNA) and it apparently remained practically unchanged until the end of 40s when the last printing of the same edition appeared. The theory presented there looks elemen-tary and many points are even not quite correct in view of the nowadays knowledge. The situation, however, changed considerably by the beginning of 60s when the second, revised edition of PNA was published and the chapter on manoeu-vring written by Mandel (1965) does not look obso-lete even today. No wonder that most of the material was reproduced with minor changes in the third edi-tion of the same reference book (Crane et al. 1989). It is interesting to note that similar level of matu-rity was achieved in the textbook by Fedyaevsky and Sobolev (1964) who presented accomplishments of the Russian manoeuvrability school which, due to obvious political causes, was developing relatively independently of the world mainstream. But during next three decades, the evolution of and advance in the manoeuvring theory resulted in cer-tain qualitative changes. Of course, by the beginning of 60s, substantial progress in understanding},

A number of popular published empiric methods for predicting manoeuvring properties of surface displacement ships have been briefly described and analysed. An extension of the Pershitz method to low speed manoeuvres has been implemented. Sixteen empiric methods and hybridizing combinations of hull and rudder sub-models were tested numerically through simulation of standard manoeuvres for the KVLCC2 benchmark ship. The obtained numerical results have demonstrated that very few methods or combinations give reasonably accurate results for this vessel and some simulated responses even look unacceptable. The primary conclusion drawn from the study is that in general application of universal empiric methods can lead to unacceptably large prediction uncertainties and such methods must be used with great care and preferably tuned on prototype ships.},

  abstract = {Numerical optimization of the initial design of a fast catamaran (high-speed sealift research model B, HSSL-B) has been carried out through a simulation-based design (SBD) framework, based on an advanced free-surface unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (URANS) solver and a potential flow solver, and global optimization (GO) algorithms. The potential flow computational fluid dynamics (CFD) SBD was used to guide the more expensive URANS CFD SBD. The fluid-dynamic analysis of the flow past the catamaran proved that the use of the URANS solver was fundamental in dealing with the multihull interference problem. In the case investigated, the separation distance was small and the viscous flow quite distorted by the proximity of the hulls, so that only viscous solvers could correctly capture the flow details. Sinkage and trim effects, due to the high speed range and again to the small separation distance investigated, are also relevant. The initial HSSL-B geometry and three optimization problems, including single- and multiobjective optimization problems, proposed by designers from Bath Iron Works, were successfully optimized/solved, and finally an experimental campaign was carried out to validate the optimal design. A new verification and validation methodology for assessing uncertainties and errors in simulation-based optimization was used based on the trends, i.e., the differences between the numerically predicted improvement of the objective function and the actual improvement measured in a dedicated experimental campaign, including consideration of numerical and experimental uncertainties. Finally, the success of the optimization processes was confirmed by the experimental measurements, and trends for total resistance, sinkage, and trim between the original and optimal designs were numerically and experimentally verified and validated.},

Heave, roll and pitch radiation damping are estimated from a non-linear unified seakeeping/maneuvering time-domain tool using numerical decay tests and then implemented to a 6--DoF model in the form of critical damping and natural period. Short waves are idealised by numerical integration along the vessel's waterline profile and associated hydrodynamic actions are implemented in a response curve format. For the rapid assessment of hull in-plane hydrodynamic forces, derivatives are implemented via semi-empirical methods, CFD or model test data. Results are validated against experiments available for zig-zag and turning cycle trajectories of vessels with different hull forms and propulsion configurations. It is concluded that the approach presented is feasible for the prediction of maneuvering trajectories of existing or new-build vessels and for estimating the evasive velocity in way of contact before grounding.},

  abstract = {There is an environmentally and economically motivated need to reduce the fuel consumption and air emissions of ships. To achieve a reduction in energy consumption, the energy flow in the entire energy system of a ship must be analysed in both the component, or subsystem, level as well as in a holistic way to capture the interactions between the components. Of the currently available energy consumption monitoring and prediction methods or models, no single model or method can be used to assess the energy efficiency of an arbitrary vessel in both the early design phase and during operation. This study presents a new generic ship energy systems model that can be used for this purpose. This new model has two parts: one for the assessment of a ship's energy consumption based on an ordinary static power prediction and one for advanced operational analysis, considering hydrodynamic and machinery systems effects. A Panamax tanker vessel was used as the case study vessel to prove the versatility of the model for five example simulations for the design and operation of ships. The examples include variations of the main dimensions, propeller design, engine layout and the operational profile on a North Atlantic route. From the results, different areas with a potential for energy savings were identified.},

The study presents how uncertainties can be categorised and handled in four different phases of a ship's life -- from early design to ship operation. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out for two environmental conditions to calculate the mean and uncertainty of the fuel consumption. The results show that the uncertainty in the fuel consumption prediction in a very early phase of the design process is approximately 12\%, whereas at a very late phase, it reduces to less than 4\%.

The model includes external forces and moments caused by the environment at sea, i.e. wind, waves and ocean currents, and solves the force and moment balances for the ship with four degrees-of-freedom (4 DOF), i.e. surge, drift, yaw and heel. To capture involuntary speed losses, engine limits are included in the model. By combining an existing power prediction model, a numerical standard hull and propeller series, and numerous empirical methods, the simulation model can be applied to conventional ships with very limited information available at the outset of an analysis, e.g. the main dimensions, engine rpm and propeller rpm. Additionally, a wind-assisted propulsion component is available. The current study describes the details of the 4 DOF model together with its applicability on three case studies on a ship route through the Baltic Sea with realistic weather forecasts. The main conclusions of the study show that there are considerable differences in the predicted fuel consumption when comparing simulation results based on 1 DOF and 4 DOF; the 4 DOF simulation model is recommended. It is shown that it is crucial to include the yaw moment balance and limits for the rudder angle when analysing ships with wind-assisted propulsion. Examples of involuntary speed losses and different modes of operation are compared and discussed, and potential problems with propeller backside cavitation and engine stalling when running a ship with a wind-assisted device are discussed.},

  abstract = {Society faces a major challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the effects and propagation of climate change. As the main contributor to global trade, the shipping industry adds significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions and must actively work towards reducing, or eliminating, emissions in a short period. This thesis contributes by developing a generic model for quick and accurate prediction of the fuel consumption of existing ships or newbuilds in operational conditions. The aim is to be able to predict the potential of fuel-saving measures, e.g., design features, retrofitting, alternative propulsion, and operational improvements, and evaluate the impact of such measures both, logistically and technically.{$<$}br /{$><$}br /{$>$}A novel energy systems model called ``ShipCLEAN'' was developed, which provides the opportunity to predict the propulsion power, fuel consumption, and daily costs and income of ships in realistic operational conditions, i.e., a wide variety of drafts, speeds, and environmental conditions. ShipCLEAN is a unique coupling of a generic power prediction model and a marine transport economics model. Aside from a calm-water power prediction based on empirical and standard series methods, the power prediction model includes simulating alternative propulsion methods (i.e., wind-assisted propulsion), respects all environmental loads acting on a ship at sea (e.g., wind, waves, current), is valid for multiple operational conditions (i.e., speed and draft of the ship), and balances the forces and moments in four degrees of freedom. Validation studies using five example ships (a container ship, a tanker, a cruise ferry, and two RoRo ships) show good agreement of the predicted propulsion power with both model tests in the design condition and full-scale measurements in variable operational conditions. A detailed uncertainty analysis provides an overview of how to further increase the prediction accuracy. {$<$}br /{$><$}br /{$>$}Special focus of the study is put on evaluating measures to decrease the emissions of ships through operational optimization, i.e., speed optimization, alternative propulsion concepts, and new design of zero-emission concepts. ShipCLEAN includes novel methods to evaluate the aerodynamic interaction effects of Flettner rotors on a ship (in between the rotors and between the rotors and the ship), to control the rpm of each rotor in an array on a ship and to evaluate the hydrodynamic forces acting on a ship sailing at a drift angle. {$<$}br /{$><$}br /{$>$}Results from application studies show that fuel savings of around 3\% are achievable by optimizing the speed profile of a ship in operation. Wind-assisted propulsion shows the potential to save up to 30\% of fuel if applied to a tanker on a Pacific Ocean trade. It is concluded that flexible power prediction models requiring limited input data help to identify and quantify potential fuel savings and to identify motivators for ship owners and operators to apply fuel-saving measures. Further, it is concluded that four degrees of freedom analysis and methods to respect aero- and hydrodynamic interaction effects are crucial to accurately predict the performance of wind-assisted propulsion.},

Until now, a bulbous bow has been often designed using Kracht charts, which were established based on model test data, but these charts apply only to ships with a block coefficient CB = 0.56-0.82, Froude number Fn = 0.20-0.40, and the obtained bulb sizes are only close to optimal. This paper presents a new method for the optimal design of bulbous bow, starting from the design of an initial bulb using Kracht charts for ships with any block coefficient or Froude number, then resizing this initial bulb to define the optimal bulb sizes based on a multi-objective function of the required power reduction, and a combined solution of Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and surrogate models. This study was applied to a fishing vessel FAO 75, which has been model tested and used to design steel fishing vessels in Vietnam recently. The obtained quantitative results showed the same trend as the theory and practice, with a reduction of the ship's required power by about 14\%.},

  abstract = {The present paper presents a numerical investigation on the potential of wind-assisted propulsion for merchant ships. In particular, a KVLCC2M hull was equipped with a set of wingsails inspired from those used in the 34th America's Cup. The combined thrust due to the propeller and the wingsails required to achieve a given cruising speed was computed by solving the equations of motion. For every wind direction, the wingsail trim was optimised with a genetic algorithm in order to minimise the thrust of the propeller. The aerodynamic forces and moments due to the hull and the wingsails were computed with Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes simulations, while the hydrodynamic forces on the hull and rudder were computed by adapting formulations developed for manoeuvrability applications. It was found that the aerodynamic efficiency of the wingsails is critical in order to gain a meaningful thrust contribution. The propeller thrust was decreased by about 10\% when sailing crosswind, and the maximum benefit was achieved by sailing at low speed in strong wind conditions. The oil saving was found to be particularly sensitive to the wingsail aspect ratio, suggesting that an efficient wingsail should employ several tall wingsails rather than a few short and larger wingsails.},

For the aspect-ratio-10 hydrofoil, tests were made in Langley tank no. 1 and Langley tank no. 2 at 0.84 and 3.84 chords submergence at subcavitation speeds from 5 to 45 jps corresponding to Reynolds numbers from 0.18 X 106 to 1.64 X 106.

Approximate theoretical solutions for the effects of the free water surface and rigid boundaries on lift and drag at supercritical speeds are developed. An approximate theoretical solution for the effects of these boundaries on drag at subcritical speeds is presented. The agreement between theory and experiment at both supercritical and subcritical speeds is satisfactory for engineering calculations of hydrofoil characteristics from aerodynamic data. The experimental investigation indicated no appreciable effect of the limiting speed of wave propagation on lift-curve slope or angle of zero lift. It also showed that the increase in drag as the critical speed is approached from the supercritical range is gradual . This result is contrary to the abrupt increase at the critical speed predicted by theory.},

Hence, this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive and updated survey of recent advances in Bayesian optimization and identify interesting open problems. We categorize the existing work on Bayesian optimization into nine main groups according to the motivations and focus of the proposed algorithms. For each category, we present the main advances with respect to the construction of surrogate models and adaptation of the acquisition functions. Finally, we discuss the open questions and suggest promising future research directions, in particular with regard to heterogeneity, privacy preservation, and fairness in distributed and federated optimization systems.},

The method takes the full scale measured shaft power of a vessel with a bulbous bow, and compares this to a calculated calm water shaft power of the same vessel without a bulb. This enables the performance of the bulbous bow to defined in terms of a change in shaft power. The shaft power of the bulb-less vessel is calculated using the Holtrop and Mennen statistical prediction. Many of the inputs to Holtrop and Mennen are draft dependent, therefore these variables are calculated for the measured draft of the full scale data, using geometrical and empirical formula. Propulsive efficiency is calculated via draft corrected wake and thrust deduction (empirically) and assuming a Wageningen B-series propeller. The effective power prediction of Holtrop and Mennen is then converted to shaft power via the calculated propulsive efficiency.},

  abstract = {For random waves the free surface elevation can be described by a number of individual wave parameters. The main objective of this work has been to study the statistical properties of individual parameters in successive waves; the wave crest height, the wave height and the wave period. In severe sea states the wave crest heights exhibit a nonlinear behavior, which must be reflected in the models. An existing marginal distribution that uses second order Stokes-type nonlinearity is transformed to a two-dimensional distribution by use of the two--dimensional Rayleigh distribution. This model only includes sum frequency effects.  A two-dimensional distribution is also established by transforming a second order model including both sum and different frequency effects. Both models are based on the narrow-band assumption, and the effect of finite water depth is included. A parametric wave crest height distribution proposed by Forristall (2000) has been extended to two dimensions by transformation of the two-dimensional Weibull distribution.  Two successive wave heights are modeled by a Gaussian copula, which is referred to as the Nataf model. Results with two initial distributions for the transformation are presented, the N{\ae}ss (1985) model and a two-parameter Weibull distribution, where the latter is in best agreement with data. The results are compared with existing models. The Nataf model has also been used for modeling three successive wave heights. Results show that the Nataf transformation of three successive wave heights can be approximated by a first order autoregression model. This means that the distribution of the wave height given the previous wave height is independent of the wave heights prior to the previous wave height. The simulation of successive wave heights can be done directly without simulating the time series of the complete surface elevation.  Successive wave periods are modeled with the Nataf transformation by using a two-parameter Weibull distribution and a generalized Gamma distribution as the initial distribution, where the latter is in best agreement with data. Results for the marginal and two-dimensional distributions are compared with existing models. In practical applications, it is often of interest to consider successive wave periods with corresponding wave heights exceeding a certain threshold. Results show that the distribution for successive wave periods when the corresponding wave heights exceed the root-mean-square value of the wave heights can be approximated by a multivariate Gaussian distribution. When comparing the results with data, a long time series is needed in order to obtain enough data cases. Results for three successive wave periods are also presented.  The models are compared with field data from the Draupner field and the Japan Sea, and with laboratory data from experiments at HR Wallingford. In addition, data from numerical simulations based on second order wave theory, including both sum and frequency effects, are included.},

The complex potential is assumed to vary linearly within each element and the solution is obtained by imposing the boundary conditions at the nodes of the elements. The other approach is based on the finite element formulation. Triangular elements and linear shape functions are used. The solution is obtained by the Galerkin method. Numerical results are obtained for the wave elevation generated by a vertical wave maker. Results are also provided for a circular cylinder oscillating below the free surface.

On the undisturbed free surface source density is used to meet the free surface condition that is linearised in terms of double-body model approach and is discretised by a one-side, upstream, four-point finite difference operator. After solving the doublets on the foil and sources on the free surface, the numerical results of pressure, lift and resistance coefficients and also wave profiles can then be calculated for different Froude number and depth of submergence to demonstrate the influence of free surface and aspect ratio effects on performance of the hydrofoil.},

  abstract = {The Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) is a frequently used infill criterion in Multi-Objective Bayesian Global Optimization (MOBGO), due to its good ability to lead the exploration. Recently, the computational complexity of EHVI calculation is reduced to O(n log n) for both 2-D and 3-D cases. However, the optimizer in MOBGO still requires a significant amount of time, because the calculation of EHVI is carried out in each iteration and usually tens of thousands of the EHVI calculations are required. This paper derives a formula for the Expected Hypervolume Improvement Gradient (EHVIG) and proposes an efficient algorithm to calculate EHVIG. The new criterion (EHVIG) is utilized by two different strategies to improve the efficiency of the optimizer discussed in this paper. Firstly, it enables gradient ascent methods to be used in MOBGO. Moreover, since the EHVIG of an optimal solution should be a zero vector, it can be regarded as a stopping criterion in global optimization, e.g., in Evolution Strategies. Empirical experiments are performed on seven benchmark problems. The experimental results show that the second proposed strategy, using EHVIG as a stopping criterion for local search, can outperform the normal MOBGO on problems where the optimal solutions are located in the interior of the search space. For the ZDT series test problems, EHVIG still can perform better when gradient projection is applied.},

Many simulation methods sometimes harm the adaptability of hydrodynamic force data for the maneuvering simulations since one method may be not applicable to other method in general. To avoid this, basic part of the method should be common. Under such a background, research committee on~``standardization of mathematical model for ship maneuvering predictions'' was organized by the Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers and proposed a prototype of maneuvering prediction method for ships, called ``MMG standard method''. In this article, the MMG standard method is introduced. The MMG standard method is composed of 4 elements; maneuvering simulation model, procedure of the required captive model tests to capture the hydrodynamic force characteristics, analysis method for determining the hydrodynamic force coefficients for maneuvering simulations, and prediction method for maneuvering motions of a ship in fullscale. KVLCC2 tanker is selected as a sample ship and the captive mode test results are presented with a process of the data analysis. Using the hydrodynamic force coefficients presented, maneuvering simulations are carried out for KVLCC2 model and the fullscale ship for validation of the method. The present method can roughly capture the maneuvering motions and is useful for the maneuvering predictions in fullscale.},

An integral relation describing the flow inside an arbitrarily truncated internal region is first obtained by applying Green's Theorem, using only the simple source function for an infinite fluid. The internal flow is next matched with eigen expansions in the upstream and downstream outer regions. The radiation condition can be satisfied exactly simply by a proper choice of the solution form in these outer regions. The method is applied to investigate flows about both lifting and non-lifting two-dimensional bodies. Agreement with existing results is excellent. The present formulation provides a simple yet rational basis for tackling the practical three-dimensional ship-wave problem, in which past workers have encountered considerable difficulties using a complicated free-surface Green function.},

The objectives of this work are to (1) review the fundamental physics driving ventilation and its impact upon the hydrodynamic and structural response, and (2) discuss the scaling relations and its implications on the design and interpretation of reduced-scale studies. Natural ventilation occurs when the flow around a body forms a cavity that is open to the free surface. The steady flow regimes, hydrodynamic loads, and unsteady transition mechanisms of naturally ventilated flows are reviewed. Forced ventilation permits control of the cavity pressure and cavity shape, but can result in unsteady cavity pulsations. When a lifting surface is flexible, flow-induced deformations can increase the loading and the size of cavities, as well as lead to earlier ventilation formation. Ventilation tends to reduce the susceptibility of a lifting surface to static divergence. However, fluctuations of fluid added mass, damping, and disturbing forces caused by unsteady ventilation will change the structural resonance frequencies and damping, and may accelerate hydroelastic instabilities. Scaling relations are developed for both the hydrodynamic and hydroelastic response. Similarity in the three-dimensional (3D) ventilation pattern and hydrodynamic response requires simultaneous satisfaction of Froude number, cavitation number, and geometric similarity. However, Froude scaling complicates the selection of suitable model-scale material to achieve similarity in the dynamic hydroelastic response and material failure mechanisms between the model and full scale.},

A mixed lognormal distribution is used for univariate probability analysis of wave data, and the method of connecting two mixed lognormal distributions with copula functions is applied to construct bivariate distribution. The results show that compared with Weibull and lognormal distributions, the mixed lognormal distribution shows good performance in fitting marginal distributions. In the bivariate probability analysis, the conditional model overestimates the probability of lower wave heights, and the bivariate function model has a poor fitting effect in the region with larger periods. In contrast, the copula model based on mixed lognormal distribution is more suited to describe the joint distribution of significant wave height and mean wave period.},

  abstract = {The conflicting gradients problem is one of the major bottlenecks for the effective training of machine learning models that deal with multiple objectives. To resolve this problem, various gradient manipulation techniques, such as PCGrad, MGDA, and CAGrad, have been developed, which directly alter the conflicting gradients to refined ones with alleviated or even no conflicts. However, the existing design and analysis of these techniques are mainly conducted under the full-batch gradient setting, ignoring the fact that they are primarily applied with stochastic mini-batch gradients. In this paper, we illustrate that the stochastic gradient manipulation algorithms may fail to converge to Pareto optimal solutions. Firstly, we show that these different algorithms can be summarized into a unified algorithmic framework, where the descent direction is given by the composition of the gradients of the multiple objectives. Then we provide an explicit two-objective convex optimization instance to explicate the non-convergence issue under the unified framework, which suggests that the non-convergence results from the determination of the composite weights solely by the instantaneous stochastic gradients. To fix the nonconvergence issue, we propose a novel composite weights determination scheme that exponentially averages the past calculated weights. Finally, we show the resulting new variant of stochastic gradient manipulation converges to Pareto optimal or critical solutions and yields comparable or improved empirical performance.},
